Aditya Bhartia : Thanks, Sagar . Good evening, everyone, and welcome to the Q2 FY25 Earnings Call of Adani 
Enterprises.  We have the senior Management of the company represented by Mr. Robbie Singh  
– CFO , Adani Enterprises, and Mr. Manan Vakharia  – Investor Relations.  I would like to 
welcome them and thank them for giving us the opportunity to host the call.  I would now hand 
the call to Mr. Robb ie Singh for opening remarks . Over to you sir.  
Robbie Singh:  Thank you. Good evening, everyone.  
We welcome you to the Earnings Call to discuss Adani Enterprise's Results announced today for 
the quarter and half year ended 30th September.  
Over the years, Adani Enterprise s has focused on building utility and infra assets, contributing 
to addressing logistics and energy transition cha llenges facing the country. AEL’s emerging core 
infra businesses under its incubation portfolio  is represented by Adani New Industries -our green 
hydrogen ecosystem, data center, airports, and road businesses, plus established business 
portfolio represented in primary industrial vertical comprising mining services, metals and 
materials, commercial mining, and industrials.  
This half year, AEL has recorded its highest ever EBITDA of Rs. 8,654 crore . The emerging 
core infra businesses recorded half year EBITDA of Rs. 5,233 crore, which is an increase of 
85% on year -on-year basis.  Total income of incubating businesses for H1 FY 25 increased 
sharply by over 63% to Rs. 17,287 crore , with the profit before tax increasing by 138% to Rs. 
2,878 crore . The consistent high contribution of these emerging core infra  boosted the overall 
consolidated results for the first half.  Consolidated EBITDA is up by 47% to Rs. 8,654 crore , 
consolidated profit before tax is up 137% to Rs. 4,644 crore  and consolidated income is up 14% 
to Rs. 49,263 crore . 
Coming to the project and operational updates on major businesses : 
Adani New  Industries ’ wind manufacturing business  continues on its development path, which 
has now crossed 300th blade production milestone  during this quarter. The RLMM listing of 5.2 
megawatt and 3 .0 megawatt wind turbine is completed, and the further final certificate of 3.3 
megawatt wind turbine is being applied for.     

 

In the electrolyzer business , we have received a letter of award for electrolyzers manufacturing 
facility of 101.5 megawatt per annum from SECI . With this , cumulative capacity awarded is 300 
megawatt per annum.  
In the airport business , the growth in passenger movements  has resulted in Adani Airport 
Holding  handling roughly 23% of India's passenger movement s. During the quarter, we also 
tested the southern runway of Navi Mumbai airport with the landing of Air Force plane and we 
expect the airport to be completed early 2025.  In this quarter, we added 6 new routes, 6 new 
airlines  and 13 new flights across the seven operational airports.  
In the road business , we completed two more road projects, which now takes the completed 
projects to six, with remaining eight projects  including the greenfield  Ganga Expressway 
progressing as per schedule. On the roads and data center business es, we'll provide a much more 
detailed and comprehensive update along with the annual results in May.  
In the Mining Services portfolio, during the quarter, AEL received letter of award for 
development and operations of iron ore mine at Taldih with a capacity of 7 million tonnes per 
annum in the state of Odisha. AEL has signed an MD O agreement for coal mine at Dahegaon 
with Ambuja Cements in the state of Maharashtra . With these new mines, AEL's MD O business  
has 9 coal blocks plus 2 iron ore blocks. During the quarter, total mining services dispatch  
volume  was up by 32% to 8.2 million metric tonnes , revenue increased by 64% to Rs. 803 crore  
and EBITDA increased by 65% to Rs. 400 crore on year -on-year basis.  
In the Integrated Resource Management portfolio, the volume for the current quarter stood at 
13.7 million metric to nnes and the revenue for IRM business stood at Rs. 9,697 crore and 
EBITDA was maintained at Rs. 927 crore.  
Under commercial mining, Carmichael mine production is now running at roughly 15 million 
metric tonnes per year with a shipment of about 3.8 million metric tonnes in the quarter.  We a re 
now open for Q&A. Thank you.  
Moderator : Thank you very much. We will now begin the question and answer session. The f irst question 
comes from Prateek Kumar from Jefferies . Please go ahead.  
Prateek Kumar:  My first question is on your capex number. First half capex  has been like Rs. 15,000 crore  based 
on your balance sheet data. How are we looking at capex now for full year because earlier we 
were anticipating a much larger capex for the full year. How are we looking at capex for the full 
year and segmental capex also, if you can provide there ? 
Robbie Singh:  For full year capex , I will go through various segments. So in New Industries, we expect the full 
year capex to be around Rs. 28,000  crore . On the Airport s side, the number including the Navi 
Mumbai A irport is around Rs. 16,000  crore . And we expect the road s to complete its projects on 
schedule with capex of roughly around Rs. 12,000  crore . Small capex would be there , but not a 
material number , in relation to water projects. In Data Center s, we expect to complete  roughly    

 

about Rs. 5,000 crore . And then in the remainder of the businesses, we expect to  complete the 
capex of further about Rs. 5,000  crore. Now the reason why this particular quarter and this half 
of the year is slightly slower than the remainder is because , as you know, in capex heavy 
business es, there's a natural cyclicality in India due to monsoons. So during the monsoon period, 
the capex slows down and it will start ramping up now and reaches its peak in Dec-Jan-Feb-Mar. 
And that peak then continues till May. And then the summer season starts and it starts winding 
down through to the monsoon. And this year the monsoon was about 6 to 7 weeks longer than 
traditional , so we might be plus or minus 6 weeks in terms of the schedule. But if you see our 
sort of operational update of June 2025, you will see that broadly capex numbers will be in line.  
Prateek Kumar:  So broadly, still we are looking at Rs. 70,000 crore capex for this year from the numbers ? 
Robbie Singh:  I would say closer to roughly 67.  
Prateek Kumar:  And sir , regarding the ANIL segment  (the new energy segment ), can you also lay out the timeline 
of projects like backward integration, module capacity expansion, where we are and when do 
we look at pilot projects for green energy and electrolyzers?  
Robbie Singh:  Yeah, like I said, what we can highlight overall  is that manufacturing,  with the exception of 
foundry, is now practically up and running. So from ingot -wafer onwards  plus the ancillary 
industries are now fully i ntegrated, which is glass, back sheet, EVA, aluminum frames. So that 
aspect for the solar model is complete. Wind turbine is also from blade,  nacelle, assembly, or 
that work is already complete. For electrolyzer s, we have started the work and we expect to give 
you an update as to how that work is proceeding in terms of construction and development of 
the electrolyzer facility by March next year. So we are pretty much progressing on the site  
development work , site civil planning work  for where the generation capacity of solar and wind 
will go has also commenced and we'll have a more detailed update towards the middle of the 
next year. For the downstream product work development, probably we will be able to give an 
update in the next 24 months, but we will have a much more detailed update in relation to the 
first two phases of manufacturing and the green power generation for green hydrogen in th e 
middle of the next year.  
Prateek Kumar:  Okay, so the capital employed for the ANIL segment currently appears very less , probably at 
around Rs. 3 ,000–Rs. 4 ,000 crore  and we are looking to do Rs. 28,000 crores capex in this year . 
So this is going t owards expansion to capacity towards number that is what I was asking in terms 
of milestones , in terms of capacity targets . 
Robbie Singh:  No, what you are referring to is the manufacturing capex only. Under Adani green hydrogen 
business, we have 4 types of capex . The manufacturing ecosystem capex , which you are referring 
to; then the green hydrogen development capex ; then the electrolyzer capex , which is the 
electrolyzer on site, that's not the manufacturing ; and then the downstream capex of the 
downstream plants. So there is a full -fledged  plan as to how we see that develop ing over a period 
of time. What you are noticing now is the civil development. So the capex  numbers will start 
ramping up, as I said, over the next year, as we go through this development phase. So currently ,    

 

the focus has been to integrate the manufacturing ecosystem that is required to start the green 
electron production for the green molecule production.  
Prateek Kumar:  Okay, sure. And can we also talk about like the airport segment? Because now the Navi Mumbai 
Airport is nearing completion, how are we looking at airlines addition or the start of flights from 
that airport by March 25 and the City Side Development projects which we are looking to 
develop at the airports to start with?  
Robbie Singh:  So the first phase of the City Side D evelopment at Ahmedabad is underway. We have one more 
airport to start. Navi Mumbai Airport should click in, like you rightly pointed out , in the second 
calendar quarter of next year. The airline addition planning continue s. This time also , we 
reported that this quarter  we also brought 6 new airlines. Various airports are starting  that will 
continue to develop.  We expect the first phase of our pure City Side Development to come on line 
by 2026. The intermodal development at Ahmedabad is already up and running, wherein 
intermodal mean s where passengers and non -passengers can mix. And similarly, in Navi 
Mumbai , it will also be ready, the intermodal development  will be ready as soon as the terminal 
is ready. The City Side D evelopment there also will be a little bit longer. But overall, we expect 
to have the City Side D evelopment in sufficiently large numbers that shows up in our EBITDA 
by end of 2026. The other aspect of airports is the development  of its JV businesses which are 
ancillary business es in airport that is also going forward as planned.  
Moderator:  Thank you.  The next question comes from Brett Knoblauch from Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go 
ahead.  
Brett Knoblauch:  Let me just talk a minute about your data center business and what you guys are seeing there in 
terms of pipeline and demand. I know obviously a big trend around the world is AI and new high 
performance compute data centers. Do you guys have any plans to b uild data centers to support  
higher shifts  that are coming to market,  and have you had any kind of talks surrounding that?  
Robbie Singh:  Yes, we are geared up, Brett, for our data center business in the ultra-hyperscale  data centers in 
the AI space and also in the GPU space. We will actually make comprehensive data center as a 
showcase presentation as part of our annua l result in May next year. It would be much more 
appropriate to go through at that time. But suffice to say we are fully geared up for that, both 
from energy supply point of view, from land, from other connectivities and civil infrastructure 
point of view for the AI data center.  
Brett Knoblauch:  Perfect. Thank you, that's helpful. And as you're thinking about the incubating businesses and 
maybe new businesses to come, would getting into anywhere on the AI supply chain or that 
market be interesting to you guys?  
Robbie Singh:  Not the AI supply chain, but we have two large service businesses within AEL, which is our 
Adani Digital Labs and our Global Capability Center. The digital infrastructure rollout and 
consequent  development of smart systems  across those two businesses is a big drive internally 
for us . We don't report them separately at the moment because they are emerging businesses.    

 

Our focus in the first phase over the next five years is to focus on the incubation of airports, 
green hydrogen and the roads business plus data center. As we go through this development 
phase of our services  i.e. digital infrastructure services businesses, we will be outlining them in 
more detail. But I expect that currently it's more of R&D type of expenditure investment. We 
expect to provide full  briefings on the development of services business es in a meaningful way 
probably towards the end of this decade when they reach certain scale.  
Moderator:  Thank you. The next question comes from Gaurav Birmiwal from Axis Mutual Fund . Please go 
ahead.  
Gaurav Birmiwal:  I just wanted your thoughts on the external market outlook for the sales of our solar panels as 
well as the turbines that we are manufacturing ? 
Robbie Singh:  That demand remains relatively stable. I think over a period of time, we expect our installed 
capacity itself to double , but that would mean our own inhouse ecosystem demand will also 
ramp up. There's no  specific market shift that we can see in the short term, but over the medium 
term, in manufacturing and in export industries, you can have market shifts. But as we mature  
in this segment in relation to the scale at which Adani Green is operating and the scale at which 
Adani N ew Industr ies will operate , I think that as manufacturing ecosystem itself will remain 
immune to outside market risks in the medium term, given how it is situated and given the scale 
at which the various sister firms of the group in this area are developing.  
Moderator:  Thank you. The next question comes from  Gopal N from SBI Life Insurance . Please go ahead.  
Gopal N:  My question was on, there is sequential moderation on the segment -wise EBITDA on ANIL. So 
can you just give some update on that why it is so?  
Robbie Singh:  I think as I mentioned, if you recall, I don't know whether you were  on th at call or not in March  
that sometimes you have order spillovers which come after the balance date, which was in the 
first quarter. So , the order book is no w tracking at about 1 gigawatt, just over 1.1 gigawatt and 
capacity is 4.5  gigawatt . So we are pretty much running at capacity for the quarter.  Last quarter, 
the 1.3 gigawatt  that was largely driven by sales recorded in that first quarter , which were 
produced during previous quarter.  
Gopal N:  And this should be the run rate for the remaining part of the year?  
Robbie Singh:  Yeah, we have about 4.5 gigawatt capacity, so we'll run at close to 1.1 -1.2 gigawatt . 
Gopal N:  And there is no change in the export market in terms of demand ? 
Robbie Singh:  No, it's pretty steady.  
Gopal N:  And sir, on this road assets  EBITDA , there is an improvement in the quarter -on-quarter and year -
on-year.  In terms of revenue sequentially there is no change. So wh at is driving this change, sir?     

 

Robbie Singh:  That's largely because of achieving the commercial operations on the two road projects.  
Gopal N:  But there is no chang e in the revenues sequentially.  
Robbie Singh:  That is just an accounting artifact , where the EBITDA numbers are now recorded because COD 
date has been achieved. So the revenue number was recorded , but because of the COD 
achievement we recorded the EBITDA into accounting  now.  
Gopal N:  And th e last bit was on interest on P& L. There is a drop sequentially and year -on-year also, 
whereas we have seen net debt going up . So how should we see it, sir?  
Robbie Singh:  I think from a practical aspect, you should assume that interest will remain steady  and slightly 
rise as our constituent businesses are  growing . This particular time, what has happen ed is that 
we do have some FX-based borrowing , so there was some FX gain that is reflected in the rates.  
Gopal N:  Can you quantify that amount?  
Robbie Singh:  Approximately Rs. 200 crore.  
Gopal N:  So that Rs. 1 ,100-Rs. 1,150 crore run rate should be ther e? 
Robbie Singh:  Yes. 
Moderator:  Thank you. The next questi on comes from Mr. Aditya Bharti a. Please go ahead, sir.  
Aditya Bhartia:  Sir, my first question is on capex on ANIL . How much capex are we envisaging for the next 3 
years? And how would you broadly split this capex into the four categories that you mentioned ; 
manufacturing, green hydrogen development , onsite el ectrolyz er and downstream capex ? 
Robbie Singh:  Broadly, we have a tighter range on the say for the next two years, so I don't want to give a  
number that could be out  materially in terms of focus . We expect that  we would have a  capex  
this year included plus the next year, roughly  around the Rs. 56,000 crore mark.  Of this , majority 
you can assume that about 60% of this or maybe slightly higher than 60% of this will be in the 
generation of the green electron. And downstream initially will be less but could be closer to 
about say  Rs. 4,000 crore. But that can shift  to a year later depending on how the schedule is 
going.  
Aditya Bhartia:  Understood. And sir my second question is, some media articles that have been there about 
Adani E nterprises looking to acquire ITD Cementation, just wanted to understand what's the 
rationale of exploring  buying a construction company?  
Robbie Singh:  AEL is not doing that at all. It's a wrong media article . As you see  roughly, I think it's on the 
third page of our presentation  and every presentation we have , there is a company called Adani 
Infra  (India) Limited, which is our construction and assurance arm, that is the entity buying this 
construction company because they need to develop their construction ecosystem given our    

 

capex rise. And because they provide construction  assurance to various group companies , they 
are continuing to enhance their ecosystem and build their capability.  
Moderator:  Thank you. The next question comes from Vineet Prasad from Investec. Please go ahead.  
Vineet Prasad:  Just a couple of questions. Firstly, we were ramping up on the wafer capacity until last quarter. 
So how is that shaped up? Have the manufacturing stabilized out there?  
Robbie Singh:  So the wafer plant is basically at a point where we started the first wafer production . We expect 
it to complete its stabilization phase over the next 3 months and then it will start ramping up to 
its capacity over the next 12 months after that from January onwards.  
Vineet Prasad:  Understood. And on the IRM and the mining side of things, how do you expect volume trends 
there for the remainder of the year ? 
Robbie Singh:  Flat to maybe slightly increasing.  
Moderator:  Thank you. The next question comes from Nirav Shah from GeeCee Holdings. Please go ahead.  
Nirav Shah:  So a few questions. First is on the airport side, I mean for our 6 PPP airports. So can you just 
elaborate on the timelines for the tariff increase because that has been approved but it has not 
been effective. So will we see all the tariff increases in pla ce by end of the  year or I mean if you 
just can give the timelines please , that would be helpful ? 
Robbie Singh:  The order was received last quarter, and it will start showing up in the numbers from the last 
quarter of this financial year and first calendar quarter next year.  
Nirav Shah:  So all six airports, tariff entries w ill be between January to June.  
Robbie Singh:  Three airports in the first, and then three will sta rt from about middle next year.  
Nirav Shah:  Middle of next year, perfect. And sir second question is just on the bookkeeping side. I mean, if 
you can just  share the EBITDA numbers for the Australian coal mines and the split in our 
manufacturing ecosystem between wind and solar.  
Robbie Singh:  Australia  EBITDA is Rs. 784 crore . 
Nirav Shah:  Rs. 784 crore ? 
Robbie Singh:  Yes. 
Nirav Shah:  So that's a sharp increase from compared to last quarter from Rs. 300 crore  to Rs. 784 crore . And 
sir, how much did we make in the wind ecos ystem ?    

 

Robbie Singh:  Wind EBITDA is roughly just about 8% of the total ANIL ecosystem EBITDA , which is half 
yearly. So about 8% is wind and 92% is the solar manufacturing.  
Nirav Shah:  This is for fi rst half o r second quarter sir?  
Robbie Singh:  First half of this year.  
Nirav Shah:  First half. I just want to ask on our guidance for MDO operations, so we had earlier given a 
guidance of 45 million tonnes for FY 25 and 55 for FY 26. And Carmichael was consequently 
having 12 million tonnes in this year and 15 million tonnes next year. So are we maintaining 
that guidance or there is  any change to it? Because we 've added a couple of projects.  
Robbie Singh:  Carmichael we are maintaining and MDO will be closer to 40 instead of 45.  
Nirav Shah:  Okay for this year and but next year should be largely same 55 . 
Robbie Singh:  Next year would be just around 50 plus minus say 4 % to 5%. 
Moderator:  Thank you. The next question comes from Prateek Kumar from Jefferies . Please go ahead.  
Prateek Kumar:  I have three follow up questions . Firstly,  on airports in international business. There's quite a 
news flow around forming like subsidiaries in international business, whether for airport 
concessions or for duty -free or other businesses. So can you just explain how are we looking at 
international airport business? Where are we, how much capex that they're looking at in this 
segment?  
Robbie Singh:  International airports will not be a material part of anything that we do in the medium term. The 
main focus remains on India. And so it's not a material number. The subsidiary formation relates 
to the fact that within Adani A irports, we have very large emerging business in relation to duty -
free. So that's more consolidating the purchasing entity in one location  so that we can streamline 
the duty -free business. And duty -free business itself also operates duty -free stores outside of our 
airport s as well. So it has its own business plan. If there's anything specific on that, it's not a 
major capex business, and is more of a concession business. So there's no capex impact of this, 
but there's a business of duty -free which will develop outside of India as well.  
Prateek Kumar:  Okay and also it includes management of inventories or buying of all products whether it's to 
sell in India or abroad ; that is also part of this business only?  
Robbie Singh:  Of the duty -free, yes. 
Prateek Kumar:  Yes, sir. And the question is on the copper business. So copper we started around six months 
back. How are the revenues and EBITDA of that segment, may  be for FY 25 expectations, or 
may be how is this 1H?    

 
Robbie Singh:  I would say for first time, meaningfully, copper will appear in our numbers in the last quarter of 
this year. And over the following 12 months, you will actually start seeing that in our metals and 
material business , because it will actually produce significant EBITDA and cash flow.  
Prateek Kumar:  And lastly on Coal -to-PVC, is there an update on  where we are in that project, say looking at 
December 26 commissioning and EBITDA of Rs. 4 ,000 crores in that?  
Robbie Singh:  Yeah, December 26 is the date you can always have like, say, maximum plus 6 weeks or 7 weeks 
due to timing of monsoon, etc. But we are on schedule.  
Prateek Kumar:  And one more question on wafer capacity. We've talked about scaling our module and cell 
capacity to 10 gigawatt in next two years. But the wafer,  we have not talked about moving from 
2 gigawatt. Is it now sort of move d to later y ears? How are we looking there?  
Robbie Singh:  No, the capacity will rise in synchronization with each other. So as we move further up  and we 
stabilize the existing w afer, we will continue to rise. But then the second part of it is capex  is 
relatively straightforward because all of the ecosystem would have developed by that  time. You 
are correc t. We haven't specifically talked about it, but I just want to clarify for everybody that 
the overall 10 gigawatt capacity will be done in synchronization , in fact, for glass, back sheet , 
EVA, aluminum frame, etc. The entire ecosystem will support a 10 gigawatt capacity.  
Prateek Kumar:  And that is expected by FY27 or F Y28 or like what period?  
Robbie Singh:  Closer to F Y28. 
Moderator:  Thank you. The next question comes from Dhananjay Mishra from Sunidhi S ecurities, please 
go ahead . 
Dhananjay Mishra:  I was asking about this generation part of the thing. So for hydrogen generation, eventually we 
will utilize solar power and wind power, which we have now. So how are we placed in terms of 
- what kind of capex we are envisaging for next year in that segment?  
Robbie Singh:  Next year capex in the generation segment in terms of what we have to build over a period of 
time whether it starts next year or rolls out even year after that , because once it starts , it adds 
quickly , but we expect over the next 2 years , the wind and solar generation capex to be in the 
order of around Rs. 33,000 – Rs. 34,000  crore . 
Dhananjay Mishra:  And what kind of capacity we are going to put in that thing in terms of overall capacity in solar 
and wind power by let's say FY27? 
Robbie Singh:  That would be roughly about close to about 7 gigawatt.  
Moderator:  Thank you. The next question comes from Bhaskar Chakraborty f rom Jefferies. Please go ahead.  
Bhaskar Chakraborty:  Could you please give us the revenues of both of WTG sales during 2Q25?     


Robbie Singh:  Sorry, revenue from?  
Bhaskar Chakraborty:  WTG sales . 
Robbie Singh:  Roughly Rs. 1 ,000 crore . 
Bhaskar Chakraborty:  During this quarter  or the first half?  
Robbie Singh:  First half.  
Bhaskar Chakraborty:  And during this quarter, please . 
Robbie Singh:  Rs. 300 crore . 
Moderator:  Thank you. As there are no further questions, I would now like to hand the conference over to 
the management for closing comments.  
Robbie Singh:  I just want to firstly just thank Investec for organizing the call  and for the participants who asked 
us the questions and the participants who attended the call. Thank you so much. If there are 
anything further, you can please reach out to Investec and then we will r espond via Investec. 
Thank you.  
Moderator:  Thank you. On behalf of Investec Capital Services, that concludes this conference. Thank you 
for joining us. You may now disconnect your line s.
