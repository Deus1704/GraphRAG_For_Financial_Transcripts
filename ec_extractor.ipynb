It is my pleasure to welcome you all to our investor‚Äôs conference to discuss the financial performance of RKEC Projects Limited for the financial year 20-21 and also share with you our way forward. RKEC Private Limited is one of the leading infra companies which has 35 years of experience in the business of marine work and bridges. Company has completed 95 projects so far worth over 1830 crores and currently working on 14 projects amounting to Rs. 600 crores. During the financial year 21 the company could complete four projects. The notable ones are electrification work of Purvanchal Vidyut Vitraan Nigam Limited and ports like JNPT. Let me come to the order book first before getting into the financials. The company carries an order value of 883 crores for execution as of 1/4/2021 and secured an order of Rs. 134 crores after the financial year brought in about Rs. 1017 crores of orders on hand considering an average turnover of Rs.300 crores for financial year 20-21, 22 and Rs. 400 crores for financial 20-22 and 23. The company is having a sufficient order book on hand. We have also submitted big (not clear) project (not clear) Rs.1000 crores approximately and is bidding for another Rs. 600 crores by 31/12/2021. Considering a minimum surface of one third, we are expected to have a very comfortable RO position, of three years‚Äô turnover being available at any point of time. When I look at the turnover, it is seen that the turnover of the company has suffered a drop of Rs. 95 crores that is 33% as compared to the turnover of the previous year. Drop in turnover was due to multiple challenges faced by the company. The first one was due to the outbreak of the pandemic right from March 2020 and impacted throughout the financial year. The major projects which have suffered set backs are port, JNPT, Adani project, Haldia Project and sea project of the Indian Navy Visakhapatnam. The second challenge was on account of the slowdown in the construction activities in the Farakka Project. The slowdown of Farakka project was mainly due to an unfortunate accident on 16/2/2020 and the subsequent investigation studies and review of the design and ranks by multiple agencies. We are happy to inform you that our clients are being approved after the completion of all studies. The project will be back on track in another three months time after the monsoon, 2021. The third reason was that the company was suffering from the working capital constraint for the last two years on account of the receivable of Rs.65 crores from SSPUVDNL. I am happy to share with you that the contract has been revalidated, work has been completed and a debt of Rs.52 crores against Rs. 80 crores have already been collected which has provided a slight relief to the working capital position of the company. We are expecting the balance payment of Rs. 28 crores during the second quarter of the financial year 2021. We are probably one of the few contractors in India to have recovered money without penalty which shows the strength of the company and its integrity level. I congratulate all my staff who have struggled to receive this and also shareholders for having confidence and stood by us for over two years. While we could mitigate the three challenges, we are still left with one challenge on the working capital credit limits from Bank of Baroda. The sanction of credit limit of Bank of Baroda has also been received during June 2021. Sanction by the Bank is not very comfortable for the company to receive the increase in turnover. Infact the major set and are confident of mitigating it in the next two months‚Äô time. We bring to your kind notice that we have not removed any of our staff during the pandemic and full salaries were paid and the directors have sacrificed their salaries to pay them as they are the pillars and strength of the company. The profitability of the company reflected EBITDA of Rs. 82.94 crores during the financial year 2021 as against the previous years‚Äô performance of Rs. 69.61 crores. Similarly, the profit after tax for the year 2021 is Rs.12.76 crores as against Rs. 27.86 crores of 19-20. I would like to state that the drop in profit is directly the result of the drop in turnover as expenditure level remained almost the same. The company has adopted IND AS requirement as NSE main board listed companies thereby improving the standard. We have appointed a new CFO Mr. Jayachandran who is highly qualified and experienced. He is a qualified finance professional who has got 35 years of industry exposure. He possesses multi various and functional experience in various industries such as engineering, infrastructure, manufacturing etc. He has been (not sure) CFO for the last 25 years into the organization. His services are expected to benefit the company substantially. Mr. Satyanarayana has opted to retire as he has attained the age of 65 years. We are confident of the way forward by regaining the growth in turnover to Rs. 300 crores during the financial year 21-22; by adding on jobs of oil & gas, specialized billing with due diligence and thereby to add value to the investors in the coming years. Our strategy and philosophy of work can be considered to optimized operational (not clear) by enhancing the project execution capability and efficient project management to capture the industry growth potential, to retain and attract talent, to go for (not sure) billing by striking a balance between the risk profile of owning versus hiring. Our resources and capabilities do consists of our track record of completion of projects, long experience as a promoter in the construction sector, dedicated, robust and successful team, own fleet of construction equipment, long-term relationship with client, high quality, cost-effective project delivery capability, timely completion of projects, reasonable asset base for the size of the company. Coming to the short-term (not clear) I should say that despite the pandemic, stringent credit sanctioning norms insisted in banks and increase in price of steel are the major ones. We are confident of mitigating all the above during the financial year 21-22. The floor is now open for questions and answer session. You may now ask questions one by one. Kindly tell us your name and the organization you represent. Question and Answer Session\\nModerator: Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question and answer session. If you have a question, please press * and 1 on your telephone keypad and wait for your turn to ask the question. If you would like to withdraw your request, you may do so by pressing * and 1 again. Ladies and gentlemen we will wait for a moment while the question queue assembles. The first question comes from Mr. Dixit Doshi from Whitestone Financial Advisors Pvt. Ltd. Please go ahead sir.\\nG. Radhakrishna: Yes sir.\\nDixit Doshi: Just a clarification, you mentioned that as on 31st March the order book was 883 crores and we received a fresh order of 134 crores after March.\\nG. Radhakrishna: Correct.\\nDixit Doshi: Okay. Now, can you mention the top three, four projects among this which will be the high-value project?\\nR. Jayachandran: Shall I answer?\\nG. Radhakrishna: Yeah.\\nR. Jayachandran: It is correct that we have got an unexecuted order value of 883 crores as on 31/3/2021 and we have also secured an order of 134 crores after 1st April. Totally it is around 1000 crores of work order on hand. The major projects are Farakka project where unexecuted order value is around 288 crores, the second one is a project of jetty construction for Indian Navy in Visakhapatnam which is approximately 140 crores. The third one is‚Ä¶there are two projects in Calcutta Fortress that is Haldia Dock Complex. Together it is around 200 crores. The next one is the order which we recently got that is a construction of a fisheries harbor in Kakinada in a place called Uppada. The project is funded by NABARD and we have a back to back contract for the marine portion which is 134 crores. We do have few other projects already ongoing, many of them are in advanced stages of completion. One another project is in the west coast of India in Karnataka; that is Honnavar where we have got an unexecuted order value of about 75 crores. So this constitutes almost 1000 crores of the order book. Almost all the projects are already mobilized and work is up and running.\\nDixit Doshi: Okay so except for I guess, there was some issue at Farakka‚Ä¶.other projects are running on right?\\nR. Jayachandran: I would like to clarify that there was the problem at Farakka but at present, we are already out of the problem, we have sensed that. Our designs and everything has been checked and our designs as CMD has made in his speech, the designs are already approved and the drawings are getting approved. In another month or one and a half month‚Äôs time we will be getting all the drawings approved. With revised drawings are primarily providing some more add ons and a few measures as added precaution and nothing else. The work will start in full swing, but due to the climatic conditions and floor conditions, maybe after the monsoons that is September, October 2021 only we can see that the main work can go in full swing.\\nDixit Doshi: Okay. Sir my next question is regarding our finances. You mentioned that there was some stress on the working capital. So what is our current bank (not clear) in terms of fund base and non-fund base. We already have pretty much a 1000-crore order. So how much more order we can bid? How much more bank guarantees we have? a cash credit limit of 37.5 crores. We are working on‚Ä¶.as far as the non-fund base limit is concerned, we are very much comfortable. As you may be knowing that after the outbreak of the pandemic, the government has given some relaxations as far as bank guarantees are concerned. Performance bank guarantees and retention bank guarantees have been relaxed to some 10% to 3%; so we are very much comfortable as far as the non-fund basis limit is concerned. However, due to the delay or due to the slowdown in the last year, we may need to pump in a bit more money as far as the working capital is concerned. Presently we have only 37.5. Ideally we should have around 60, 65 crores of working capital‚Ä¶.65 to 70 crores we may be requiring and we are sourcing it. We are working on various fronts only and we will be able to do it. This is required because we are planning to bring the turnover back to 300 plus in the current year.\\nDixit Doshi: With this 210 crores, limit and 37 crores CC limit, how much more order you can bid for maximum?\\nR. Jayachandran: As far as today we have about 14 projects up and running of which in the current financial year we will be completing and getting out around 8 to 9 projects because almost all of them are in advanced stages of completion; almost completed or substantial completion. By the year end if there is no further orders coming to us, we will be left with only five orders. So essentially we have the resources where we can definitely open up three to four major projects in the size of 200 crores; we can at least open three to four projects and we have also bid for two projects and we are confident of at least getting one out of it. So one or two projects more we will be able to get in the current financial year. Our strategy is that to always keep the order book on hand almost free of turnover. The reason is that the average delivery time is also 2-1/2 to 3 years‚Äô time. So we should be in a position to get once the‚Ä¶after finishing 1000 crores, third is what is going to be completed during the current financial year may be about 400, 500 600 crores may go out of the books, so additional 400, 500, or 600 crores will come in. So definitely we can accommodate another 600 to 700 crores of order even with the existing scale of things.\\nDixit Doshi: Okay. Coming to our receivables, you know it has gone up sharply; almost 143 crores. Is there any more than six months or more than one year old receivables and if you can mention how much it is?\\nR. Jayachandran: I could not get you, the voice is not clear‚Ä¶143 you are talking of what figure?\\nDixit Doshi: I was saying that our receivables are almost 143 crores as on March end. So is there any slow moving like more than six months or more than one year old receivable and if you can mention the amount‚Ä¶how much it is?\\nR. Jayachandran: Actually the receivables are around 168 crores as per the audited accounts which consists of retention amount which is payable as per the terms of contract after the (not clear) is over. We don‚Äôt have any receivable which is stressed as of today. It was not the case in the last two years. We had one major stressed asset of around 65 crores in the books from a client called Purvanchal Vidyut Vitraan Nigam Limited which is what CMD was expressing in his speech that we are probably the So I could say that there is no receivable in the books as of today which is stressed, not even stressed which is not (not clear). To substantiate my statement I should say that we had renewed all the sundry debtors on 31st of March, all the receivables and we have found that two of the receivables which are almost 5, 6 years old, we in fact have written off these two debts. One from a company called SEW which has already gone to NCLT and the second one is also gone to NCLT called IVCRL. About 3.4 crores of debts which we ourselves assessed that yes there could be a stress and there is a doubtfulness on the case which we have analyzed and we have written off. So at at the end of the day today we have not even a stressed asset in our books as far as receivables are concerned.\\nDixit Doshi: I understand that except for Purvanchal there is no stress on the receivables. But how much of this would be more than six months old?\\nR. Jayachandran: As of now, there is hardly about 20 to 25 crores more than six months old. That also more than six months old because it is receivable as per the payment term in the contract. For example, retention money held by the client will be on a stage payment. For benchmark completion only they will release the money, that is the reason why. Number of days wise it is more than six months otherwise it is payable as per the contract once we achieve that benchmark completion.\\nDixit Doshi: Okay, one last question from my side. This year we did about 15%, 16% EBITDA margin and we are planning to do a top line of 300 crores in FY22. What kind of margins‚Ä¶..I mean we can sustain this 15%, 16% margin given the kind of commodity price hike‚Ä¶?\\nR. Jayachandran: I think this is a very good question. I think we should be able to‚Ä¶\\nG. Radhakrishna: Mr. Dixit I would like to answer your question‚Ä¶two questions. First question was you were saying 37.5 crores how much order book can you book? This was your question earlier I think. We will be completing some of the projects; whatever is there as explained by him about 8 to 9 projects we will be completing and in addition we can definitely take up around 600 to 1000 crores in this financial year, additional works of around 600 to 1000 crores in this financial year provided we enhance our credit limit to another s30 crores which we are doing and probably within another two months we should be able to do that. And the question asked, achieving the PBT and all that we are in a very positive mode to move to that extent but being in the pandemic situation and all we may not be able to commit to that level what would be the exact figures and all but we must be earning definitely better than the present year position sir.\\nDixit Doshi: So 15%, 16% EBITDA margin you feel is a sustainable margin?\\nR. Jayachandran: Yeah, it is not impossible, it can be achieved. We are not saying that it cannot be achieved but we do not know what kind of‚Ä¶.. As far as receivables, there is no problems there.\\nG. Radhakrishna: Thank you sir, I think we answered all your questions.\\nModerator: Thank you sir. The next question comes from Mr. Jitu Punjabi from EM Capital Investors. Please go ahead sir.\\nJitu Punjabi: Yes good afternoon Mr. Radhakrishna how are you?\\nG. Radhakrishna: Good afternoon, thanks sir, how are you.\\nJitu Punjabi: I am very well. Sir I wanted to just ask a couple of things. One the point that there is a constraint for working capital‚Ä¶..is there a path to resolution there? In the sense the point you made in the last question was that we will do X number of projects and then we will replace it with new projects and we are doing and we should reach a reasonable turnover over the next 12 months. But if the working capital is constrained, that may not be doable. So the question is that, is there a path to resolution on the working capital constraint side?\\nG. Radhakrishna: Resolution has been passed in the last board meeting sir and we have already approached‚Ä¶.we are trying for multiple banking sir and we have applied for annuity to Bank of Baroda which we will be getting very shortly. Two or three banks are ready to process and issue the working capital.\\nJitu Punjabi: Okay, good‚Ä¶.I mean in the next few months that should be resolved, is the point you are making.\\nG. Radhakrishna: I think in the next two months it will be resolved, that‚Äôs what we are hoping now. Anyway the next two months are also the monsoon period and we may not be able to progress much on the work, by that time we will try to get the capital and in the next six months we will try and do a good amount of job in the next six months. In the third and fourth quarter we will be doing a good amount of job.\\nJitu Punjabi: Okay so we should be able to catch up on the business side?\\nG. Radhakrishna: Yes sir. We are very confident now when compared to the last year. You must be knowing of our stress on Purvanchal‚Ä¶.I was giving you all the information whatever is there. Now we are very confident of getting out of that.\\nJitu Punjabi: Tell me is there any further receivable beside the 15% holding money is there? Any outstanding from Purvanchal corporation today?\\nG. Radhakrishna: Yeah we have received around 52 crores out of 80 crores sir and 28 crores is still the balance.\\nJitu Punjabi: And what is the time line of getting that now?\\nG. Radhakrishna: Maybe in this quarter we should be able to get it sir.\\nG. Radhakrishna: Not full money, we are supposed to get around 12 crores, last month which we didn‚Äôt get. May be this week or next week we should be getting it and the balance they promised by this month end or maybe by this quarter end we should be able to get the balance sir.\\nJitu Punjabi: Okay, wonderful. Then my other question is that, you have been through a very difficult two years. You are just coming out of it. As you come out of it, what do you think the next two, three, four years can look like? Do you think you can scale up significantly to 4000 crores turnover? I don‚Äôt know what‚Ä¶.is a significant scale up from here possible as you see the next few years ahead?\\nG. Radhakrishna: Sir this is a very good question sir. I think I have been answering this right from my investor‚Äôs meeting in Bombay somewhere around 2017. We have been saying that at the time when we go to the public our turnover was around 100 to 150 crores and I said we will go up to 300 to 400, stabilize this for about three years and then move on for further. The main‚Ä¶.basic reason why we want to go like that is, I want to develop my own strength of staff with me rather than scaling up so much projects higher, getting people from outside, we do not understand what is on their mind; by the time we understand their mind, the project is over and we may be either this side or that side. So I want to have a very stable and strong foundation by making (not sure) at the range of 300 to 400 crores, stabilize for three years, develop the fresh talent from the people we have taken up and then give them more projects in the future coming over here. So maybe around 300 to 500 we will stabilize in the three years and then afterwards we will scale upto 1000 crores. This is our plan actually.\\nJitu Punjabi: Okay wonderful. In the current‚Ä¶.lesser than 18 months, I am assuming capital was a constraint and that is getting solved for in terms of debt lines of credit; the receivables are an issue and that is getting resolved. Do you see any other‚Ä¶.and you seem to be sitting on a pretty good order book. Is there any other constraint that you envisage over the next 18 months to achieve the growth objectives?\\nG. Radhakrishna: I don‚Äôt feel there is any constraint sir. The only constraint that we are facing as of now is on the steel‚Ä¶..there is no material available in the market because of this pandemic, increase in diesel prices or non-availability of raw materials in the steel industry we are facing a little bit of constraint; I think probably this should be resolved very shortly sir.\\nJitu Punjabi: Okay wonderful sir. Our good wishes are with you. Thank you.\\nG. Radhakrishna: Thank you very much sir.\\nModerator: Thank you sir. The next question comes from Mr. Nikhil Shah from Ubhed Trading LLP. Please go ahead sir.\\nNikhil Shah: Thank you very much. Am I audible?\\nG. Radhakrishna: Yes. mentioned as 42 crores; whereas in the annual report it is mentioned as 28 because I think there is a one-time GST cost of 13.3 crores which was mentioned as exceptional item; so is this just a kind of‚Ä¶.how should I read this 42 crores of FY20 number?\\nR. Jayachandran: I understand that your question is that there is an abnormal expenditure on account of GST in the year 1920, yes it is a fact that we had an abnormal expenditure of GST in the year 1920 to the extent of 13.3. My only answer in that is, that every year there is something or the other abnormalities or uncertainties do capture. So probably I think once you compare 28 should be as a (not sure) when we compare one to one even though it is a bit abnormal. Current year we have got some increase in price of steel which is not fully captured in the escalation formulae in the contract. So something or the other keeps on happening. Only thing is 1920 it was slightly on the higher side, that‚Äôs it.\\nNikhil Shah: No, no my question is not that sir. My question is there is the annual report figure and the table of results which was released yesterday, the profit after tax for FY20 is different. My question is that.\\nG. Radhakrishna: It cannot vary.\\nNikhil Shah: Yeah you can cross-check for that. I will wait for that. My second question is, if you look at the operating margin and I am defining operating margin as sales minus cost of materials, construction expenses and changes in inventory. If I take this as your operating margin, it has been shrinking over the last four years and of course may be FY21 is not a comparison so to speak; but the trend has been that it is shrinking. So how do we see this going forward? Is it that a function of that as the turnover increases the margin will shrink? Is that the perspective here?\\nR. Jayachandran: Yeah, if you look at‚Ä¶.if it is a mix of all in the sense that different contracts we operate at different margin. The overall margin has not shrunken. Overall margin remained almost the same. So the individual projects, dominant projects, suppose if I do X projects which is having 15% or 20 % margin, and that project was the dominant turnover in that particular year that precisely is at a better positioning and it consumes maybe more material; some projects consume more labor. So it is not a very‚Ä¶.unlike a manufacturing unit, it is individual contract conditions and the pricing, bidding‚Ä¶all those things matter actually. But overall I am clear that there is no shrinking in the profitability except for 20-21.\\nG. Radhakrishna: In short if I were to answer your question it is yes, sir. As we keep on increasing our turnover there is a possibility of reduction of the percentage of the profit.\\nNikhil Shah: Okay, but what you said is in the one to two years, you don‚Äôt expect the EBITDA margins to drop substantially right?\\nG. Radhakrishna: Yes, it will not drop sir. We are telling you right from the beginning we are very strong in making our own capex and making our own machinery which sells more than 30% to 40% of cost on our capex. That is the reason we have good margins and there is not much problem in this. We may be facing a little bit of but external factors like pandemic and all‚Ä¶.otherwise, we should be able to do good job in the next financial year, maybe 21-22.\\nNikhil Shah: Okay. The last question, the net fixed assets have been flat for the last two years of 55 crores, so do we expect this to increase in line with the increase in the business turnover also or is this good enough for the next couple of years?\\nR. Jayachandran: You are looking at the fixed assets and the capital expenditure?\\nNikhil Shah: That‚Äôs right.\\nR. Jayachandran: Yeah, definitely the assets in the present level of operations we are comfortable. But definitely depending on the new jobs which we are going to get, we will be definitely going for some more capital expenditure may be to the tune of 50 crores roughly. Around 50 crores we have kept in mind as the capex which will be required. The funding will not be an issue because we are practically debt free.\\nNikhil Shah: Okay and the last one is, CMD mentioned about‚Ä¶.one thing to stabilize between 300 to 500 crores and then kind of making the next leap. So how many years do we see ourselves being in this 300 to 500 before we kind of move to the next band?\\nR. Jayachandran: I think CMD has given an indication‚Ä¶line of thinking to be stabilizing maybe 300 to 500 for three years, the first year is running, so maybe another two years.\\nNikhil Shah: Okay thank you. If there are any follow up questions, I will come back in queue.\\nR. Jayachandran: Please do. But I think there is no difference in the figures which I clarified to you. If you can send us a mail, clearly specifying which document to which document, we will answer you on mail itself.\\nNikhil Shah: Okay I will send you the document also with the reference. Thank you.\\nR. Jayachandran: That‚Äôs fine, thank you.\\nModerator: Thank you sir. The next question comes from Mr. Dixit Doshi from Whitestone Financial Advisors Pvt. Ltd. Please go ahead sir.\\nDixit Doshi: Thanks for the opportunity again, just a couple of questions. One, how much is the order bid pipeline?\\nR. Jayachandran: I think we have bid for two projects, the estimated cost put to bid for these projects to government are around 1000 crores. The technical bids are under evaluation and we expect in a months‚Äô time we will know where we stand. In one These are the two bids we have already submitted and as CMD has mentioned in his speech, we are also working on bidding for some more projects of around 600 crores.\\nDixit Doshi: Okay. Just a last question, whatever order we had currently under execution almost 1000 crores, are these projects on a fixed price basis? I mean let‚Äôs say, steel, cement and all these prices went up even further, can we pass on to the customer or it‚Äôs a fixed price project?\\nR. Jayachandran: Almost all the contracts are either on EPC or BOT basis and on all the contracts there is a provision for escalation. How far the escalation will take care of these abnormal market situation and how far these abnormal market situation prevails is again a guess of everybody. But we feel that this will be a short-term phenomena and will not be persisting for a long time. Hopefully, I think we will be having a slight impact on this, but we have also represented to the clients that there is an abnormal increase so we may have to be compensated suitably. It is only a petition so let us see if it is not persisting for a long time, probably we may not be much affected.\\nDixit Doshi: Okay sir, that‚Äôs it from my side, thanks.\\nModerator: Thank you sir. Ladies and gentlemen if you have any questions please press * and 1 on your telephone keypad. The next question comes from Mr. Munish Kumar an individual investor. Please go ahead sir.\\nMunish Kumar: Good afternoon Mr. Radhakrishna. I was hearing you. My compliments to you on ensuring that all your employees were paid their salaries during the pandemic, signs of a really good company; thank you. My question is‚Ä¶.a couple of questions. What was the impact of the second wave on your quarter one performance? Also I am very curious to know is there an impact of Farakka incident on the future orders from NHAI? Over to you sir.\\nG. Radhakrishna: Yes impact of the second wave is a little bit higher sir and we are sorry to inform you that we have lost 5 to 6 of our employees and one or two sub- contractors also and we are very pained by that and most of our people are demoralized by the pandemic situation. But the way we have looked after all the staff and all the staff have been covered by insurance even if these people got affected, they have got an extra benefit of Rs.10,00,000 as insurance benefit for them in addition to the PF of Rs.7,00,000 or something. So all people are taken care of and I am sure my strength is our staff which I looked after well and we will be able to cover up whatever backlog we are having in the second wave of pandemic‚Ä¶.we should be able to cover it up in the future. There is no problem from our side.\\nMunish Kumar: Okay sir and what is the impact of this Farakka incident on any future orders from NHAI?\\nR. Jayachandran: As far as Farakka incident is concerned, we had already clarified and CMD also made in his speech that we are out of the issues as such as far as the job of Farakka is concerned. But still we still carry‚Ä¶we are in the holiday list of the NHAI for a period of 3 years, that means upto February 2023. But we are confident that once we start the work in full swing we will be getting out of the holiday list for sure. we are not affected because we do have order book on hand upto 2023 sufficiently even as of now even without even depending on NHAI‚Ä¶further jobs at NHAI. But our aim is to get out of the holiday list by this year end.\\nMunish Kumar: Alright sir. Thank you and again my compliments for being so human as an organization. Thank you, I am done with my questions.\\nModerator: Thank you sir. The next question comes from Mr. Gurjot Aluwalia an individual investor. Please go ahead sir.\\nGurjot Aluwalia: HI, good afternoon everyone. Thank you for the opportunity. I have a question around the receivable. If I look at the annual report of four years back around 2017, at that time‚Ä¶.and throughout 2016-17. In 2016 the revenue of the company was 113 crores and the receivables was around 20 crores. If I look at it from 2017, the revenue was around 200 crores and the receivable was around 40 crores. Again this year the revenue turnover is around 200 crores but you are talking about receivables which are 160 crores. So it is concerning as an investor to see that the receivables are increasing so sharply and also as the dividend is not being paid out in the last couple of years may be because the cash conversion is low. So it is sort of concerning us whether the company is actually able to get the receivables on time and convert it into cash so that three, four years trend is not showing in a good light for the company.\\nR. Jayachandran: Sir we are happy to inform you that out of 168 crores of debt which is shown in the books, in the first quarter of 21-22 that is as of 30th of June, we could collect 80 crores out of this. So the figure is fading down to -80 crores so round about 88 crores is today‚Äôs position. The major recovery which we could asset is basically Purvanchal Vidyut Vitraan Nigam Limited and other customers. About 52 crores is from Purvanchal Vidyut Vitraan Nigam Limited. Further as earlier clarified by CMD, 28 crores is further receivable from one of the clients Purvanchal Vidyut Vitraan Nigam Limited which will also be collected in the current quarter, maybe in a month or two‚Äôs time. This month itself we will get around 12 and the balance we are expected to get before September. So I think the concern is real concern of the high receivables as compared to the turnover, but I am sure that may be the half year figures will definitely out do this.\\nGurjot Aluwalia: Okay, fantastic to hear this. I probably missed this. So already almost 100 crores will be getting collected very quickly, 80 you have already collected. I did not know this, so that really helps. And then on the dividend payout is there any policy the company has? Because two years the dividend was paid‚Ä¶last year because of the pandemic company wants to conserve cash‚Ä¶now, again I don‚Äôt know whether this year again you plan to pay any dividend going forward because you want to scale up your revenue? So what is the policy of the company? Is there any dividend payout policy?\\nG. Radhakrishna: Yes. We already said we will be paying the dividend every year without fail but due to the pandemic and the three challenges that we have faced, we could not do it these two years but however wait for the AGM, in the next board meeting we will decide upon and come up with a (not clear) on that sir. clearly tells the shareholders of what the company plans so that we remain consistent and shareholder also knows that this is where the company is utilizing the cash and what is the plan going forward. So that we don‚Äôt have to worry about whether there is some inconsistency or payouts or in terms of how the company is utilizing cash one year and the next year it is different. So if there is some consistency that will be very good.\\nR. Jayachandran: We will sincerely note and take note of this concern and we are not averse and the policy will be taken care actually.\\nGurjot Aluwalia: Alright thank you so much. All the best.\\nModerator: Thank you sir. Ladies and gentlemen if you have any questions please press * and 1 on your telephone keypad. The next question comes from Mr. Dixit Doshi from Whitestone Financial Advisors Pvt. Ltd.

Radhakrishna: Sure. We will take care of it sir and we will see after every financial result we will have a concall.\\nDixit Doshi: Yeah, thank you sir.\\nModerator: Thank you sir. The next question comes from Mr. Vinay Kumar from First Abudhabi Bank. Please go ahead sir.s it sor\\nVinay Kumar: Good afternoon to you, my question here is on the debt equity. Over the last three four years it has been gradually increasing. I believe in 2016, 2017 it was 0.4, 0.6‚Ä¶.I think currently it stands at around 0.8, 0.9. Will you be ensuring that it remains under one as we go ahead with higher turnover and profits being booked at in 21-22, 22-23? That‚Äôs my question‚Ä¶debt to equity.\\nR. Jayachandran: As we have explained earlier, we have been having a stress on working capital and funds position and we have not gone for higher debts actually so far. In fact practically we are debt free once we get a (not clear) no profits, I think we have also planned for a capex of 50 crores when the debts shall flow in. With that the position may be changing. As such the debt equity ratio more or less remain the same I should say. Not much of a change. Rather the debts which we have taken is coming down. Of course it is a game of debt and equity. Equity remaining the same and debt not being increased, the position is that but one more point which we will have to manufacturing of many of the equipments of our own with materials and expertise (not clear) items. So this also has probably helped the company in keeping the margins in place. So it is a give and take on both sides. Hopefully I think we are on the right track and when the new projects come then we will look for equipments which will have longer usage so that it will (not clear) its own.\\nVinay Kumar: Alright thank you for the clarification.\\nModerator: Thank you sir. Ladies and gentlemen if you have any questions, please press * and 1 on your telephone keypad. I would now request Mr. Jaya Chandran, CFO of RKEC to give closing comments. Please go ahead.\\nR. Jayachandran: Good afternoon everybody. Thank you all for participating and CMD and his team, the Hem Securities and all the shareholders for their questions and valued suggestions.

Due diligence strengthened for selection of clients in future.\\nModerator: We will now begin the question & answer session. The first question is from the line of Ruchi Shah who is an individual investor. Please go ahead.\\nRuchi Shah: How are the tendering activities going on with the same government coming back to power and how many orders have you already bid for?\\nG. Radhakrishna: Madam, we have bid for about 5 projects worth around Rs 303 crores and we are planning to bid for another 6 projects.\\nRuchi Shah: What is the total order book as of now?\\nG. Radhakrishna: As of now, we have an order book of around Rs 1145 crores out of which balance to be executed is Rs 783 crores as on today.\\nModerator: The next question is from the line of Hardik Jain from White Stone Financial Advisors. Please go ahead.\\nHardik Jain: Sir, if you can just help us what is our banking limits that we have today?\\nG. Radhakrishna: Our limit as of today is non-fund based 150 crores and fund based 50 crores.\\nHardik Jain: Non-fund based includes bank guarantee, performance guarantee, and all that?\\nG. Radhakrishna: Yes.\\nHardik Jain: I think you mentioned in the call last time that you wanted to increase it to 300 crores and you are talking to Bank of Baroda regarding that, right? RKEC Projects Limited June 19, 2019\\nG. Radhakrishna: Yes.\\nHardik Jain: On today‚Äôs non-fund based limit of Rs 150 crores, we have an order book of Rs 1150 crores. So, basically with this bank guarantee facility that we have, we can bid for or we can handle Rs 1150 crores order. If our banking facility‚Äôs non-fund based is increased to Rs 300 crores, then can we handle projects of say worth Rs 2000 crores?\\nG. Radhakrishna: As I addressed in my initial comments, we are targeting another Rs 500 crores of projects this year.\\nHardik Jain: One small question on the accounts. I was looking through the financials. Last year, the other expenses was 8 crores which also included the IPO expenses. So, basically on an organized level, the other expenses were only Rs 6 crores and it has increased to almost Rs 13 crores this year. So, is there a particular head which has contributed to this increase?\\nG. Radhakrishna: This year if you take it up, the increase in LC and DC processing charges have been put in this head and because our works have increased, the insurance cost also has increased by around some Rs 2 crores I think. Then, there were bad debts written off to the tune of around Rs 75 lakhs. All that added up to increase in this other expenses.\\nModerator: The next question is from the line of Chitresh Lunavat who is an individual investor. Please go ahead.\\nChitresh Lunawat: Congratulation for the good year. I had a few questions. One was regarding the UP project where we have receivables of around Rs 63 crores. Any realistic dates by when we can expect the money to come and how much money can come realistically?\\nG. Radhakrishna: By September end, that money will be with us. Out of Rs 63 crores, about Rs 15.93 crores is the performance guarantee amount. Leaving that, I think the balance amount will be with us.\\nChitresh Lunawat: We will be continuing with completion of the Rs 35 crores left for that project?\\nG. Radhakrishna: We will be completing the balance project also. The talks are going on in that fashion. Committee has been deployed. The committee is preparing a report. By July end, we will get the report and we will start the work maybe probably by July end, and they said they wanted about 2 months to release our old balance.\\nChitreshLunawat: So, in the 82 crores receivables, 43 crores is only for this particular project, right?\\nG. Radhakrishna: Yes.\\nChitreshLunawat: In the rest 40 crores, how much would be more than 6 months old? RKEC Projects Limited June 19, 2019\\nG. Radhakrishna: Out of the rest, 32 crores is for the retention monies being held by various departments. Those retention monies will be released as and when the work is completed.\\nChitreshLunawat: Okay, 32 crores of retention money and 43 crores for UP project.\\nG. Radhakrishna: Yes. If you remove around 75 crores, the balance left is 30 crores which is running expense and it keeps coming. No problem in that.\\nChitreshLunawat: Also, our payables have increased very sharply to 75 crores.\\nG. Radhakrishna: Payables have increased because we have just started a new big project in Farakka. That is the reason why the trade payables have been increased. It is a huge project and it is an EPC contract. It is not an item rate contract. In an EPC project, generally what happens is they keep paying the money on the milestone basis, not on the items. Quantity, they don't pay. They pay on completion of work. That is why huge trade payables will be there and they will be cleared as soon as those payments keep coming to us.\\nChitreshLunawat: So, we are not facing any issues in the Farakka project for receiving of the payments?\\nG. Radhakrishna: As of now, by god‚Äôs grace, we are not facing any of the issues.\\nChitreshLunawat: How many milestones are there for the Farakka project totally? We have completed 2 milestones, right?\\nG. Radhakrishna: There are 2 more milestones; at the end of second year and next is completion.\\nChitreshLunawat: Our end of the year target for the order book would be around 1000 crores?\\nG. Radhakrishna: Around 1300 crores we are expecting the order book should be there. Order book will be more but work to be executed should be around 1000 crores this time.\\nChitreshLunawat: So, we will be completing 300 crores this year and 1000 crores would be remaining at the end of the year, okay.\\nModerator: The next question is from the line of Hardik Jain from White Stone Financial Advisors. Please go ahead.\\nHardik Jain: Sir, there is a work in progress of 9 to 10 crores in this year-end. How much more we wish to invest in the CAPEX?\\nG. Radhakrishna: We will be investing another 20 crores. RKEC Projects Limited June 19, 2019\\nHardik Jain: And this will be done in this year?\\nG. Radhakrishna: Yes, this will be done in this year.\\nHardik Jain: So, fixed asset will increase by a total of 30 crores by the end of this year, right?\\nG. Radhakrishna: Yes sir.\\nHardik Jain: This CAPEX is basically done for Farakka?\\nG. Radhakrishna: These 9 crores is basically for Farakka only and addition of maybe another 5 crores in this financial year is for Farakka. Those expenses will be written off in the next 3 years itself.\\nHardik Jain: So, this CAPEX what we are doing will be written off in 3 years?\\nG. Radhakrishna: Yes, in 3 years.\\nHardik Jain: I think we get some customer advances which are part of current liability. What is the amount of customer advances that we have today?\\nG. Radhakrishna: It is only 2 crore 34 lakhs.\\nHardik Jain: As per your presentation, most of the projects that are to be completed is in FY20. If we just go by the schedule of date of completion that you have mentioned, the value of remaining work is total 783 crores out of which almost 500-550 crores we have to complete during this year. So, if we conclude, then can we achieve around 400-crore turnover this year because your deadline is mostly you have to complete these projects by this year?\\nG. Radhakrishna: Yes, we have to achieve. There is no other option for us and we will achieve also.\\nModerator: Next, we have a follow-up question from the line of ChitreshLunawat who is an individual investor. Please go ahead.\\nChitreshLunawat: Sir, I also wanted to know about the Drone projects. We were targeting around 250 employees I believe for the Drone thing this year. Any updates on what‚Äôs happening in that area?\\nG. Radhakrishna: Because we were not able to control expenses on that, we have closed that project.\\nChitreshLunawat: Currently being in the liquidity situation and all the NBFCs and banking institutions which are facing severe liquidity crunch, what is your take on that? Because our fund-based limit is only 50 crores and we are targeting around 400 crores. Could you please guide us on that? RKEC Projects Limited June 19, 2019\\nG. Radhakrishna: One good news is that our Purvanchal work is getting settled. We have an amount of around 50-60 crores held up there. We are getting that amount by this September. Because of that only, we are going for additional 500 crores of jobs. With that, I feel we may not have any financial crunch now. We can do it with our own internal accruals.\\nChitreshLunawat: How much is the bank guarantee for the Farakka project?\\nG. Radhakrishna: It is around 75 crores.\\nChitreshLunawat: 15%, okay. And who are our bankers currently?\\nG. Radhakrishna: Earlier it was Vijaya Bank, now clubbed with Bank of Baroda.\\nChitreshLunawat: The limits you told are combining both of them, right sir?\\nG. Radhakrishna: Yes, we are presently having 200 crores with us. Now we have asked for enhancement to 300 crores. The proposal is going today. Maybe in another 1 month, we should be able to get the approval.\\nChitreshLunawat: Sir, what is the management‚Äôs view for the next 3 to 5 years? What do you want to achieve? What do you want to do?\\nG. Radhakrishna: We would like to move up and emphasize more on our core competence rather than getting into some other work because there is no change in the government. The present BJP government must be going for more on infra work. With lot of bridges and lot of things they had already announced, with coming onto that, I think we can choose and pick up the jobs rather than going for a competition from now on. This is what I feel. Next 5 years will be a good business for us provided we have this fund based and non-fund based limits more.\\nChitreshLunawat: Any milestone we have set for us like what we want to achieve, like 2000 crores?\\nG. Radhakrishna: We have today a target of maintaining a turnover between 400 to 500 crores for the next 3-4 years, stabilize ourselves, make our staff to understand what is our view, what are our priorities, understand the system, and then we would like to jump for the next phase of around 750-800 crores, stay there for about 3-4 years and then move further forward.\\nChitreshLunawat: We will be completing this 512-crore project maybe next year, I mean 1 to 1-1/2 years. So, now are we eligible to directly bid for a project which is 500 crores plus or we still need joint venture?\\nG. Radhakrishna: Our limit should be around 400 crores as of now. That 500 crores job what we got is because of joint venture with Chinese company. RKEC Projects Limited June 19, 2019\\nChitreshLunawat: Correct sir. Just wanted to understand our limit now.\\nG. Radhakrishna: On our own, we can bid projects up to 400 crores.\\nChitreshLunawat: What is the current status of how much order have we applied? Are we alone in anything?\\nG. Radhakrishna: Not yet because the elections are just over. They are still to settle down. Maybe in another 2 months, we should be able to get a couple of jobs into our account.\\nChitreshLunawat: So, we have already something in pipeline, okay.\\nG. Radhakrishna: Yes, we have got some 5 jobs in pipeline. We are confident that we will be getting 2 jobs out of those valued at around 225 crores and we are trying for another 300 crores with some other department. So, with that, this year I think that should be enough for us.\\nChitreshLunawat: And the question was regarding the competition. Earlier you told that one of your competitor was very, very aggressive and was taking away all the projects but now being in the liquidity situation, how do you feel the competition now itself regarding infrastructure projects?\\nG. Radhakrishna: I was telling you that we have the option of now only pick the jobs. Whatever jobs we want, we can pick and then quote rather than going into the competition. Because our liquidity position and all are good, I don't think we will have to go for a competition. If we wait, the jobs will automatically come to us.\\nChitreshLunawat: That is a very nice situation to be in. so, we can expect PAT margin of around 9% to 10% for this year as well?\\nG. Radhakrishna: If everything goes well, definitely we can expect.\\nModerator: The next question is from the line of Ashok Shah from LFC Securities. Please go ahead.\\nAshok Shah: Sir, we had some outstandings from completed projects from some government institution. What is the current situation and outstanding from which other companies is pending?\\nG. Radhakrishna: By September end, we should be able to get that money back to our account.\\nAshok Shah: The outstanding which was from some government institution or government project, have we approached any legal arbitration or something like that?\\nG. Radhakrishna: Nothing, we have no arbitration or legal anything as of now.\\nAshok Shah: What is the figure of this outstanding? RKEC Projects Limited June 19, 2019\\nG. Radhakrishna: Outstanding is around 82 crores as of now with us. Out of 82 crores, 43 crores is from Purvanchal which we will be getting by end of September. 32 crores as retention money for the work which will be given only after completion of the work.\\nAshok Shah: Purvanchal, did we get something during the last 6 months?\\nG. Radhakrishna: We didn‚Äôt get anything. By September, we will be getting the amount.\\nAshok Shah: We are following through the legal procedure or it is a normal procedure?\\nG. Radhakrishna: It is an amicable settlement.\\nModerator: The next question is from the line of Nilesh Karani from Magnum Equities. Please go ahead.\\nNilesh Karani: I just wanted to understand in the next 2 years or 1 year if you can give us a guideline like how our company will be panning out?\\nG. Radhakrishna: Last year, we had given you a growth of around 15% to 20% is what we had promised but we couldn‚Äôt do that because execution of one work was delayed. This growth of 15% to 20% last year about 50 crores and the coming year should be around 60 crores. So, we will be adding up at least 110 to 120 crores additionally this year. That means, it should be around 350 to 400 crores this year.\\nNilesh Karani: How would be our margin outlook like?\\nG. Radhakrishna: EBITDA would be around 13% to 15% and PAT would be between 8% to 10%. So, on 350 crores, around 25 to 30 crores of PAT you can expect.\\nModerator: As there are no further questions, I would now like to hand the conference back to Mr. G. Radhakrishna for closing comments.\\nG. Radhakrishna: Before we close this session, let me once again assure you that we are here to take the company to the next level and create significant value for all stakeholders by delivering exceptional quality projects resulting in superior shareholder returns in the medium-term perspective. We propose to move forward in a steady manner. On behalf of RKEC, we would like to thank you all for participation in this conference call amidst your busy day. Thank you and have a wonderful time ahead. Jai Hind.\\nModerator: On behalf of RKEC Projects, that concludes this conference. Thank you for joining us. Ladies and gentlemen, you may now disconnect your lines.\\n\",\n",

They are going to give us the approval for Rs. 300 crores.\\nHardik Jain: And how much is our share in the JV?\\nRadhakrishna Garapati: It is actually 51% and 49% but the overall work will be executed by us and we give them only a part profit. Whatever the profit we get it, we will give them 2.75% .\\nHardik Jain: So basically this 51% and 49% is what the shareholding?\\nRadhakrishna Garapati: Shareholding which has to be given to NHAI.\\nHardik Jain: But we will get 97.25% of the profit?\\nRadhakrishna Garapati: Yeah.\\nHardik Jain: At the time of the IPO analyst meet, you said that one of the main reasons for our margins to, that are really high is because most of our equipment are our own and we do not hire them, so do you think that with this kind of order book that is increasing, our equipment that we have will be sufficient enough to cater for Rs. 300 crores top line that we are mentioning?\\nRadhakrishna Garapati: Whatever equipment we have earlier is only for our Marine work. Now we are entering into bigger projects, so we may have to increase our CAPEX, at least to around Rs. 70 crores to Rs. 80 crores.\\nHardik Jain: So this year how much CAPEX have you planned?\\nRadhakrishna Garapati: It must be aroundRs. 35 crores to Rs. 40 crores for this year\\nModerator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of ChitreshLunawat, an individual investor. Please go ahead.\\nChitresh Lunawat: I would like to know about the Gujarat project, Rs. 250 crores worth Gujarat project which we were bidding. So any update on that?\\nRadhakrishna Garapati: We had bid for two projects. Out of which one project was held up due to non availability of environment clearance from government. And the other project, will open anytime before this month end.\\nChitresh Lunawat: That project is Rs. 250 crores kind of project size?\\nRadhakrishna Garapati: Yeah, it is around Rs. 260 crores odd.\\nChitresh Lunawat: Now we heard plans of like BG and CAPEX, so any fundraising plan from the promoter like pledging of shares or by like how are we raising the fund?\\nRadhakrishna Garapati: We will have to pledge the shares, otherwise without collaterals no bank is giving financial assistance, you see the bank scenario has changed, without collaterals they are not giving any bank guarantees or anything, so we have no option except to pledge the shares. That is our last option.\\nChitresh Lunawat: Any plans to raise further equity like FPO?\\nRadhakrishna Garapati: As of now nothing.\\nChitresh Lunawat: Apart from this Rs. 525 crores project, any other guidelines? As you have told you bid for around Rs. 1,400 crores project and success is around 30% to 40%, so we can expect more Rs. 500 crores to Rs. 600 crores worth of projects this year?\\nRadhakrishna Garapati: Yeah. By this financial year end we will be reaching around Rs. 1,300 crores order book value.\\nChitresh Lunawat: And also any update on the Drone subsidiary like what is happening there?\\nRadhakrishna Garapati: Yeah, Drones actually we have tendered works of around Rs. 28 crores and we received orders to the tune of Rs. 8.07 crores. We are expecting another Rs. 10 crores in that.\\nChitresh Lunawat: So this year how much we did for drone subsidiary like how much revenue from that?\\nRadhakrishna Garapati: These are works got during the current year. We have started executing now. Regarding the drone, entering into Defense is not that easy but we are still trying our level best. Our R&D department is trying very hard to get into their specifications. We have a strong team on Board Admiral Satish Soni, General P. R. Kumar, then Wg Cdr Sreedhar, Brigadier G S Narayan, to guide us on the same. It may take some more time for us to get into this because there are many big players and it is becoming difficult for us to enter directly. But we did not lose our hope, and our team is working hard. It may take 2 to 3 years to get a real picture.\\nChitresh Lunawat: So are we talking with someone for Joint Venture for technology collaboration or it is our own technology?\\nRadhakrishna Garapati: We opened our own R & D cell. We are in the process of negotiation with some professionals and get them board. Depending on the advantage that the company gets, we will try and get things done.\\nChitresh Lunawat: We have around Rs. 12 crores of fixed assets, but we are able to manage like revenues of around Rs. 200 crores to Rs. 300 crores, any idea like how we are able to manage such a high revenue with this low fixed assets?\\nRadhakrishna Garapati: Please repeat the question.\\nChitresh Lunawat: Yeah, I was talking about fixed assets. As per the annual report the fixed asset was Rs. 12 crores. So am I wrong there like any numbers for the fixed asset currently?\\nRadhakrishna Garapati: So actually if you look at the fixed assets, as given the balance sheet the, historical cost of acquisition of the asset is Rs. 38.32 crores and the book value is around Rs. 14.25 crores and we do maintain the assets well. So if you really look at the asset value as a replacement cost, it is not Rs. 12 crores, it is much rose. Maybe you can say on a practical sense, it is around Rs. 60 to Rs. 70 crores as far as utilization is concerned. As well as revenue generation is concerned. So the Rs. 12 crores which we have concluded may not be very correct.\\nModerator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Ronit Ramesh from Finance Managers. Please go ahead.\\nRonit Ramesh: First question is on the trade receivables. Sales is around 20% but your receivables that is on a double, why is that the reason?\\nRadhakrishna Garapati: Can you speak a little louder?\\nRonit Ramesh: Question is on Trade receivables which are around Rs. 40 crores to Rs. 82 crores. Why is that doubled? And also can you tell me debtors more than 6 months in this?\\nRadhakrishna Garapati: It is a fact that the trade receivables has gone up to Rs. 82 crores for the current year. This is mainly because of one project where around Rs. 45 crores is actually due from the work specified that is on rural electrification work of PurvanchalVidyut Nigam Limited. The work certified for payment, the total work value of the contract is around Rs. 120 crores and work certified for payment is Rs. 84 crores and actual payment received is Rs. 45 crores. So this is basically a back ended pricing formula which they are following for the release of payments. And practically the work for Rs. 106 to Rs. 110 crores have already been completed. So we expect the position should improve in current year once the work is completed. Because the end of work we should get higher payment.\\nRonit Ramesh: By when is that?\\nRadhakrishna Garapati: That should be another four-and-a-half months from now. It is a state government project, even though part of funding is coming from central government. The project is managed by the state government.\\nRonit Ramesh: Okay, so this is a receivable from state government only no?\\nRadhakrishna Garapati: Yeah, actually the project is managed by state government. So we expect that this position should improve by maybe September-October 2018 and once we are able to wind up the project.\\nRonit Ramesh: Okay, so that was one of the main reasons why your short term borrowing has spiked from almost Rs. 0 crores to Rs. 13 crores?\\nRadhakrishna Garapati: For the current year cash credit limit has gone up, from last year March it was 0, current year it is approximately Rs. 13.5 crores of borrowing is there. We do expect realizations on some of the projects like Cochin to some extent from JNPT in the first quarter of current financial year, so around Rs. 36 crores is expected from two of projects. So I think this position will improve by end of first quarter.\\nRonit Ramesh: And Cochin Liquid Terminal is completed, the order is done with?\\nRadhakrishnaGarapati: Yeah, the order is completed. But final handing over is expected in another one-and-a-half month's time and thereafter money will be released. Realization of around Rs. 27 crores is expected from Cochin and another Rs. 10 crores from other projecst. So this cash possession or the overdraft possession is getting in a better position by end of first quarter or maybe July 2018.\\nRonit Ramesh: But in the last con call you said that Cochin is almost complete and almost 85% to 90% is done and only the maintenance type of thing is going on you almost finished with this. Is there been a delay?\\nRadhakrishna Garapati: No, there is no delay on our part and there is an extension given by the Cochin Port Trust. Out of this Rs. 82 crores, Rs. 15.26 crores is due from Cochin. Some more billings are expected to take place. So what I was trying to tell you is that from the Cochin project alone, a cash inflow of approximately Rs. 27 crores is expected by the first quarter or latest by July 2018. So once that happens, the cash position of the company will improve.\\nRonit Ramesh: And around Rs. 40 crores from the state government for the other projects?\\nRadhakrishna Garapati: It is actually the project of Indian Oil Corporation and they have entrusted undertaking of this project through Cochin Port Trust.\\nRonit Ramesh: In your last con call, your revenue guidance for FY19 was Rs. 350 crores if I am not mistaken. Has it come down to Rs. 300 crores for FY19 now?\\nRadhakrishna Garapati: We have not said anything. We said that achieved every year, there will be an increase of 20% to 25% and we have received around 21% this year. Next year maybe we will be seeing another 30% to 35%.\\nModerator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Ashok Shah from LFC Securities. Please go ahead.\\nAshok Shah: Out of this Rs. 826 crores orders which we are executing can you tell how much is Defense sector?\\nRadhakrishna Garapati: Defense would around Rs. 150 crores.\\nAshok Shah: Only Rs. 150 crores and remaining is for the Marine or the Road sector?\\nRadhakrishna Garapati: Marine will be another Rs. 200 crores and balance will be the bridges.\\nAshok Shah: So in case of this Defense, the billing is every 15 days or every 30 days?\\nRadhakrishna Garapati: Billing is 15 to 30 days.\\nAshok Shah: And in Marine and Road sector?\\nRadhakrishna Garapati: Marine also same, because they are all Central Government only. Road sector would be around 52 days.\\nAshok Shah: So how much time do they take to release the payment after we bill them?\\nRadhakrishna Garapati: Actually as per contract it is 52 days. But generally what we do is we request them and get the first initial 70% payment within 7 to 10 days. And balance will take 52 days to certify and then give the balance 30%.\\nAshok Shah: So any other money left to be collected, returns money from any end of the past projects which we are expected to receive?\\nRadhakrishna Garapati: Nothing.\\nAshok Shah: Retention money, no money to be received?\\nRadhakrishna Garapati: Retention money is there, retention money would be around some Rs. 20 crores which is to be received which we will be receiving on completion of these projects.\\nAshok Shah: So during this current year or it takes more than 1 year?\\nRadhakrishna Garapati: During current year, we may receive around Rs. 15 crores.\\nAshok Shah: It is already billed in the accounts or it will be extra showing as accounts during the current year?\\nRadhakrishna Garapati: Please repeat the question.\\nAshok Shah: This retention money around Rs. 15 crores which we are expecting to receive during the current year. Is it billed in the accounts or it will be billed as and when it is received?\\nRadhakrishna Garapati: We have already accounted for the retention money, because the work is done, and the money is due. It is only held up for a future event that is handing over and taking over etcetera has to take place. It is more clear, in the Rs. 82 crore of debtors rather Rs. 20.6 crores is retention money. And this money will come to us, it is already approved to us, it will come after the future event takes place that is handing over or final commissioning depending on the individual conditions of each contract.\\nAshok Shah: So as stated by Mr. Radhakrishna, we expect to have Rs. 1,300 crores order book by end of FY19, so how many orders we will be bidding or planning under stage? What is the requirement of working capital have been increased or we are bidding with the same project because our order execution is only 25% in the 19?\\nBrigadier G. S. Narayana: I think if we understand you correctly,we have already got almost a confirmed order book of Rs. 826 crores in our hand. We are also bidding for another Rs. 70 crores plus another Rs. 1,300 crores which are under submission. So we expect, as Mr. Radhakrishna has already explained in his opening remarks, that in the Rs. 570 crores we expect more than what was the confirmed ones and others we expect around 40% to 50% of success rate for us as per our due diligence and experience. So the bare minimum we are expecting around Rs. 1,300 crores of order book on hand probably by the third quarter of financial year 2018-19.\\nAshok Shah: So my question is aboutRs. 1,300 croreswe would be requiring additional working capital?\\nBrigadier G. S. Narayana: I will come to that point. That also has been explained. Presently our credit limit is around Rs. 120 crores of non-fund base limits and Rs. 15 crores of fund based limit, both are with Vijaya Bank. We have asked for an enhancement of credit limit to Rs. 250 crores of non-fund base limits and Rs. 50 crores of fund base limits. And out of Rs. 250 crores also we have asked for Rs. 50 crores of LC limits which will be exchangeable. So the quantum jump of around more than double is expected and the proposal is in the final stages of approval by the bank. We are also in touch with other banks for further extension of the credit limit. So we do not find any issue as far as the credit availability even in the stressed financial market as of now.\\nAshok Shah: On the Rs. 120 crores what is the interest rate we are paying?\\nBrigadier G. S. Narayana: Rs. 120 crores of non-funds is mainly used for the bank guarantees and LCs.\\nAshok Shah: what is the the interest rates which we are paying?\\nBrigadier G. S. Narayana: Rs. 120 crores we do not have it is mainly used for issue of BGs. commission is around 1.5% as far as we are concerned. And for the fund based limit, which is used as working capital, the interest rate is around 12.65%.\\nAshok Shah: When the company is going to hold AGM? Is it annually/every quarter\\nBrigadier G. S. Narayana: AGM I think it will be in September and the venue will be in Visakhapatnam which is the registered office of the company.\\nAshok Shah: Why so much time of 5 months is required to prepare annual report? AGM can be held at the earliest stage also?\\nBrigadier G. S. Narayana: Yeah, we did note your point, we will look at it. Your point is noted about the AGM. It depends on the availability of the Directors. We will look at your point.\\nAshok Shah: Please hold the AGM earlier and give the results in every quarter if possible because it would be very good gesture form the management.\\nBrigadier G. S. Narayana: Yeah, we will try and pre-pone the AGM depending on the availability of the Directors and then accordingly we will take it up.\\nModerator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Darshit Shah from Nirvana Capital. Please go ahead.\\nDarshit Shah: Just one question related to employee expense. So if you look at this for second half, now the employee expense is almost Rs. 5 crores versus Rs. 10 crores what we paid in first half. So can you explain why that was?\\nBrigadier G. S.Narayana: I think the employee cost in the first half was slightly on a higher side because that time we have started the operations of earlier vertical for the technology transfer and other consultancy services which has been an employee cost has been incurred in the first half. That is one time or it is not recurring in the second half. That is why the second half is showing a lower figure.\\nDarshit Shah: Can you quantify that amount roughly?\\nBrigadier G. S. Narayana: There was expenditure towards starting of earlier vertical where we took some consultancy services and Director‚Äôs remuneration was also coming in the first half. Director‚Äôs remuneration and expenses for starting of UAE vertical for hiring certain technocrats have been incurred in the first half of the year.\\nDarshit Shah: How many employees do we have on roll currently?\\nBrigadier G. S. Narayana: 300.\\nModerator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Vivek Gautam from GS Investments. Please go ahead.\\nVivek Gautam: My question is in case of government plants we are facing lot of difficulties in form of delayed payment and lot of delay in tendering finalization. So why are we not targeting the private sector also for our tenders and other orders, sir?\\nRadhakrishna Garapati: The problem what we are facing is with the State Government. There is no problem with the Central Government. We have been working with private companies in the past and you can see that the receivables of Rs 11.32 Crores are from them and not from central Government.\\nVivek Gautam: But both private companies were in your marine infrastructure only because you have done the work I believe for Essar Port, and Vadinar Port and other private sector ports also?\\nRadhakrishna Garapati: We have done for CuddalorePort Company Private Limited which is holding an amount of around Rs. 6.25 crores. We have done for Visakhapatnam Port Trust ss a sub contract for SEW and around Rs. 2.5 crores is held up with them. Rs. 1 crores to Rs. 1.5 crores which has to come from IVRCL. So all these are private companies only\\nVivek Gautam: Private companies these are all mostly bankrupt companies now SEW, IVRCL but I meant to say about that private sector ports which are coming up because we have specialization in marine and in private?\\nRadhakrishna Garapati: We have opted for another port, Honnavar Port in Karnataka which has come up. We are also trying to quote with Adani. We did a job with them and they are happy with us. Our main focus is mostly on Central Government jobs and defense.\\nVivek Gautam: Okay but there the receivable issues crop up in the government sector?\\nRadhakrishna Garapati: Government there is no receivable issues, there is no issue with the Central Government. Only the retention money it will take a little bit of time, all other payments especially Central Government we get it within 15 to 20 days of submission of our bill.\\nVivek Gautam: And what about competition intensity we are facing USP of our company which is helping us and the opportunity size for our sector?\\nRadhakrishna Garapati: Competitions are now actually strict. There is a little bit of competition on the marine side, but on the road sector the competition is less. The project releases were very high and there will not be any further contractors to quote probably in next one year. There is so much of work or very little work.\\nVivek Gautam: So are we going into road sector beside marine?\\nRadhakrishna Garapati: At present we are going into only the bridges and if at all there is a concrete work like EPC contract, we are trying to go into that because we are expert in concrete work.\\nVivek Gautam: So how is the opportunity size for such type of projects for us in NHAI?\\nRadhakrishna Garapati: NHAI the good opportunity is there, sir.\\nVivek Gautam: Good opportunity?\\nRadhakrishna Garapati: Some of the bank guarantees we have with us. With the bank guarantees the opportunities is endless.\\nVivek Gautam: So we are trying to contact other banks also for enhancing the bank guarantee and other things?\\nRadhakrishna Garapati: We have gone with the Union Bank of India, we have given our proposal maybe they will also sanction about Rs. 150 crores shortly.\\nVivek Gautam: But most of the PSU banks are facing difficulty right now in disposing credit. So why not we approach some private sector bank also\\nRadhakrishna Garapati: We are approaching, we are approaching the private banks also, NBFC banks also we are approaching but when we are doing a Central Government jobs all the bank guarantees are to be given by a scheduled bank only. They will not accept any private bank, bank guarantees.\\nVivek Gautam: That is strange because now the business is moving from public sector bank to private sector banks now in India especially in the corporate side also?\\nRadhakrishna Garapati: Yeah, it might take some time but we are working on it. We are working on getting with private banks at least the cash credit limit we are trying to work with the private banks wherein we are getting an interest rate at a lesser rate.\\nVivekGautam: Okay, opportunity size remains quite good for our sector sir?\\nRadhakrishnaGarapati: Yeah, it is good.\\nModerator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of R. Ranjan Kumar, an individual investor. Please go ahead.\\nR. Ranjan Kumar: I had few queries which were cleared earlier. So I do not have any queries right now.\\nModerator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Deepak Agrawal from Impetus Advisors. Please go ahead.\\nDeepak Agrawal: What is the breakup of Rs.117 crores revenue, what all projects contributed to this? Rs.117 crores revenue in the second half, what all projects have contributed to that? Can you give the breakup of Rs. 117 crores revenue?\\nRadhakrishna Garapati: In the second half we had some construction of Jetty at Visakhapatnam, Cochin Port Trust and then Purvanchal, then from Pondicherry. JNPT is also there, there we got around Rs.13 crores.\\nDeepak Agrawal: How much is from Purvanchal?\\nRadhakrishna Garapati: I will just tell you. Contribution of revenues for Cochin Port Trust is around 42%, Purvanchal‚Äôs around 28%, DGNP Defense project is around 19%, others are around 11%.\\nDeepak Agrawal: Okay so currently we have some Rs. 250 crores order on executed projects and in addition we have Rs. 800 odd crores of projects in hand?\\nRadhakrishna Garapati: It is not in addition. Rs. 826 crores is inclusive of this Rs. 250 crores.\\nDeepak Agrawal: What is the expected margin on these orders that we have in hand?\\nRadhakrishna Garapati: PAT would be anything around 7% to 10%.\\nDeepak Agrawal: And what do we expect on the CAPEX front this year?\\nRadhakrishna Garapati: CAPEX we might increase around another Rs. 50 crores to Rs. 60 crores.\\nDeepak Agrawal: Rs. 50 croresto Rs. 60 crores CAPEX?\\nRadhakrishna Garapati: Yeah.\\nDeepak Agrawal: We have a growth level of around Rs. 14 crores now?\\nRadhakrishna Garapati: We are entering into the bridge segment which would be around Rs. 1,000 crores this year. As this is a new segment, we have to purchase equipment and machinery. So CAPEX might go up to Rs. 50 to Rs. 60 crores this year.\\nDeepak Agrawal: Okay and last March 17 we had advance from customers of around Rs. 45 crores. Now we have only Rs. 15 crores so what is in there?\\nRadhakrishna Garapati: Advances are deposited with the department and as the work progress, Department will deduct the advances. Hence advances have come down as we keep coming close to the completion of the project.\\nDeepak Agrawal: Yeah but the total revenue is rising our business is rising so why should advances come down, for the new projects also are we not getting advances?\\nRadhakrishnaGarapati: New projects, we are still to take the advance. We are still to take because all the advances are on interest payment. The coming season is monsoon period so we should not lose any interest on this monsoon period that is why we are holding. Once this monsoon ends, wherever the requirement is there then we take advance from them.\\nDeepak Agrawal: Are we paying interest on these advances?\\nRadhakrishna Garapati: Yeah we have to pay interest on the advance.\\nModerator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of SubramaniamYadav from Subhkam Ventures. Please go ahead.\\nSubramaniamYadav: Sir just had few clarifications. The order book of Rs. 820 crores we would be executing Rs. 300 crores this year FY19, so we are left with Rs. 500 odd crores. And you are expecting another Rs. 800 crore of inflow this year so that we could reach around Rs. 1,300 crores of order book at the end of the year, right?\\nRadhakrishna Garapati: Another Rs. 500 crores.\\nSubramaniamYadav: Another Rs. 500 crores so you would be ending the year with Rs. 1,000 crores of order book, right?\\nRadhakrishna Garapati: Yeah.\\nSubramaniamYadav: And sir can you give me the breakup of this Rs. 82 crore receivables, the Rs. 26 crore is from Cochin, right?\\nRadhakrishna Garapati: I will give you the breakup. Indian Oil Corporation Cochin Port is around Rs. 15 crores, CuddalorePort Rs. 6 crores and the major receivable is from PurvanchalVidyut Nigam Limited which has already been clarified. So the dues from Purvanchal is around Rs. 48 crores. So Rs. 48 crores from Purvanchal, Rs. 15 croresfrom Cochin Port Trust, Rs. 6 croresfrom Cuddalore and other ports together is around Rs. 25 crores.\\nSubramaniamYadav: And sir, the CAPEX earlier you said it was around Rs. 40 odd crores, now you are saying Rs. 50 crores to Rs. 60 odd crores, so what is the exact amount?\\nRadhakrishna Garapati: See all the projects what we are taking up is on EPC. The equipment depends on our design whatever it comes. Suppose the span is taking as 45 meters span then that will reduce the cost of the equipment which is there. If I take the 60 meters span the cost of the equipment goes up. So these are all in the design stage so we will not be able to give you the exact figure. We will also go for an asset building by striking a balance between the rich profile of owning versus hiring.\\nModerator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Nikhil Shah Cnsultants. Please go ahead.\\nNikhil Shah: Just couple of clarifications. So in terms of the order book position, just to clarify we said that it is Rs. 826 crores which includes the Rs. 500 crores with the Chinese partner and if we execute Rs. 300 crores in the year then it comes down to Rs. 500 crores. Which means that at the end of FY19 in terms of unexecuted order book it will be Rs. 1,000 crores not Rs. 1,300 crores, right?\\nRadhakrishna Garapati: Yeah it will be around Rs. 1,000 crores.\\nNikhil Shah: Okay and in Rs. 1,000 crores by the end of FY19 what would be the composition of bridges sector sir?\\nRadhakrishna Garapati: Bridges sector would be around roughly Rs. 600 crores to Rs. 700 crores.\\nNikhil Shah: Rs. 600 crores to Rs. 700 crores and that is why because all your equipment is more in the marine side for bridges because it is constituting 60% to 70% of your unexecuted order book you will need CAPEX. And this CAPEX will be spread out right so in terms of the depreciation impact it will probably be?\\nRadhakrishna Garapati: It will be spread out in next five to ten years.\\nNikhil Shah: Yeah but I am saying the depreciation impact and the interest of it will start kind of flowing in as and when your execution increases, right? So as a result of this, the impact of interest and depreciation offset by the growth in the business, so what kind of margin expansion are you looking at sir in FY19 PAT level?\\nRadhakrishna Garapati: Yeah, PAT level we are saying right from the beginning we will maintain between 7% to 9%. See not only that you have to consider ongoing projects of around Rs. 250 crores with us. Most of ongoing projects most of them will be completed. So in the completion we get little bit of more income. Being government companies they will pay more amounts at the end. So you strike a balance between this and that.\\nNikhil Shah: Fair enough. Sir, one last question on an average what would be the split of your order book between Central Government and State Government?\\nRadhakrishna Garapati: We are thinking of not taking any more State Government jobs. At present, we are trying to taking up only Gujarat Maritime Board that is the only one State Government job what we will be having it and in Visakhapatnam we have one small work which is about Rs. 20 crores job. We have taken up because it is an iconic project and we want to show our position in the State. So the ratio must be around 75% to 25%; 75% Central Government 25% State Government.\\nNikhil Shah: Correct. So right now Central Government 75% expected to go up to 100% by end of FY19 when you have an order book of Rs. 1,000 crores unexecuted, right?\\nRadhakrishna Garapati: No, it will remain around 80:20 ratio.\\nNikhil Shah: 80:20 ratio will be Central Government, State Government and about 60%, 70% will be bridge projects.\\nRadhakrishna Garapati: Yeah.\\nModerator: Thank you. The next question is a follow up from the line of Hardik Jain from Milestone Financial Advisors. Please go ahead.\\nHardik Jain: In marine projects we used to get advances from the government but is that the same case for the road projects as well where we get some advances from the Central Government?\\nRadhakrishna Garapati: Yes sir, same. But for the road projects the interest rate for NHAI project is lesser.\\nHardik Jain: How much have we charged in marine and what is the interest rate over here in NHAI?\\nRadhakrishna Garapati: In port sector, it is PLR (Prime Lending Rate) plus 4%. Whereas in NHAI Contracts/Agreements it is bank lending rate which is now probably around 6.5%.\\nHardik Jain: It is quite less, okay. And sir, in terms of margin profile is marine projects have a better margin than bridges or they are almost the same?\\nRadhakrishna Garapati: The last twenty years I have been in marine projects and we have developed our own machinery for our works. If we have to purchase the machinery from outside, it costs around Rs.100 but then if we are manufacturing the same machinery on our own, it is costing around 60% to 70% so there is a saving of around 30% to 40% in the cost of the machinery. That is the reason you find a little bit more margin on the marine side.\\nHardik Jain: Right, so that means to say as our order book tilts towards bridges and roads where we are not manufacturing our own equipments and we are purchasing from outside, the margins in the bridges segment will be lower than what we have witnessed earlier?\\nRadhakrishna Garapati: Whatever bridge work that we taking up is on River Ganga, is almost again a marine type of work only.\\nHardik Jain: Okay so in that project the Ganga River project the bridge that we are making we will be using some of our own equipments?\\nRadhakrishna Garapati: Most of the foundation work, we will be using the equipment what we have. And other works we will have to either buy it or take it on hire.\\nHardik Jain: Okay because that is what I was wondering because when you are saying that; 7% to 9% PAT margins and what we have seen because the tilt is towards bridges, will we be able to maintain this 7% to 9% PAT margins?\\nRadhakrishna Garapati: That is the reason why we are not entering into the road sector, though we have got lot of opportunities. Whenever we take up the work, the package is around 60 to 80 kilometers. Managing one kilometer is far easier than a road package of 60to 80 Kilometers. We have very good control in bridges due to the located projects and we have control over this but when you go in 60 kilometers controlling will be difficult. That is the reason we get a PAT value on the road sector a little bit less and on the bridges if you organize well you get a higher margins because the number of components in a big project is only around 6 to 7 like concrete, reinforcement, bearings, tiling etcetera but whereas when you go into the roads, you have got so many items. There is also a lot of problem with land acquisition, and theft also is another issue. So whereas in bridges, we concentrate at one location security and all will be easier. That is the reason we are trying to concentrate only on major bridges. And River Ganga bridge what we are doing is one of the prestigious projects of Prime Minister of India. He has chosen around 13 bridges on River Ganga, and out of which five bridges have been completed, three bridges are on tendering stage and another five bridges they are going to ask for bids. So this is one of the prestigious projects and we will not have any tax flow issues or anything on this project.\\nHardik Jain: Okay and we were considering some of the gas pipeline link projects are we considering any of such projects, are we bidding for those projects?\\nRadhakrishna Garapati: We had bid for two projects but we have not been successful. We are still trying.\\nModerator: Thank you. The next question is a follow up from the line of Rohit Ramesh from Fund Managers. Please go ahead.\\nRohit Ramesh: Yes, I just wanted to know who are your main competitors in this bridges segment.\\nRadhakrishna Garapati: In the Bridges segment I think, there are around eight to nine parties which are bidding. They are the only competitors for bridges and we are waiting for them to get exhausted. Once they are full, we will enter and then get into the good job. So we do not want to waste our bank guarantees and all in a competitive tenders rather than wait and then if we can get a good job like how we got the Farakka job.\\nRohit Ramesh: Are there today like Titagarh wagon that give you competition in bridges segment?\\nRadhakrishna Garapati: Your voice is not clear.\\nModerator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Jitesh Burma, an individual investor. Please go ahead.\\nJitesh Burma: Sir, I have a question on our H2 result. So if we compare this against H1 we have kind of a flattish growth, if you could just explain the reasons and how do we see this half year the H1 for FY19?\\nRadhakrishna Garapati: See in H1 we got the JNPT work. We just started the JNPT work but as we started proceeding with the works and we have done around Rs. 20 to Rs. 25crores job. But when we executed the project, when we have gone into one of the item they have. They have given only Rs. 5 crores for that work whereas that work cost around Rs. 140 crores. So the department is in a fix whether they want to get the work executed through us or call for a separate tender. In my last two three visits, finally I think they are going for a separate tender and unless they execute that work, we will not be able to execute our job that is the reason there is a delay of about six months. Maybe we should be able to cover up only in the second half of the financial year‚Äô19. That was the main reason why the turnover has been reduced in the second half of last year.\\nJitesh Burma: Okay sir and how do you see that, because we are already in June, the second week of June so how do we see this half year the first half year of FY19 if you could throw some color on how it is going right now?\\nRadhakrishna Garapati: Half year ‚Äô19 may not be that encouraging because whatever projects we have tendered are on engineering procurement and construction. So the three works are on design now. So we have to take the design, submit the design, get the approvals of the design and then start the execution. So it might take around three to four months for us to get all these things done. So maybe first half may be a little bit dull but by the year end, we will be able to cope up and get a better result.\\nJitesh Burma: Okay and you just mentioned that we are also exploring an option for hiring equipments and we earlier said and we have repeated that one of our strength and the reason we enjoy better margin is because we use our own equipment. So how do you see this mix changing and how this will impact our bottom line?\\nRadhakrishna Garapati: See what happens is, as I just explained you there is a foundation work and the foundation work has got around 700 tiles. For executing this work in one season we will be requiring about 4 machines. The cost of these machines would be around Rs. 5.5 crores to Rs. 6 crores. So if I have to purchase all those machines and after the work s are over I will have to roam and get only those works. So we may get into problems. We get ourselves whether to purchase the machine or to take it on hire which is more economical for us. If they are available on the market and are available on hire, we take it up finish the work in one season and then come out of that we get our margins.\\nJitesh Burma: Okay can we still enjoy the similar margins that we at present enjoy in the existing project?\\nRadhakrishna Garapati: Whatever I have promised you we will definitely maintain it, no problem.\\nModerator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we take the last question from the line of SubramaniamYadav from Subhkam Ventures. Please go ahead.\\nSubramaniamYadav: Sir, any indication when will be get the Purvanchal receivables of around Rs. 48 crores any indication from their side?\\nRadhakrishna Garapati: It might be around four-and-a-half to six months as explained to realize the complete amount.\\nSubramaniamYadav: Okay at least are they realizing part payment or something like that or?\\nRadhakrishna Garapati: Yeah, they will be realizing part payment.\\nSubramaniamYadav: Okay have we recently got anything from them?\\nRadhakrishna Garapati: No, we did not get anything.\\nSubramaniamYadav: Okay and what is the reason they are mentioning sir for this?\\nRadhakrishna Garapati: It is not the question of reason. See this is a rural electrification job, what is happening is we have to finish all the jobs then commissioned, give the supply and unless we give the supply and get a certificate from the local Panchayat President, they will not release the payment. And this work is in UP, that is the reason you have to work in difficult condition. So it is not a small thing to get into. That is the reason it is taking time.\\nSubramaniamYadav: Okay. So end of the year how much can we be able to receive from this Rs. 48 crores?\\nRadhakrishna Garapati: End of the year I think we should be able to completely get the amount.\\nModerator: Thank you. I now hand the conference over to the management for closing comments. Thanks and over to you, sir.\\nRadhakrishna Garapati: Thank you. Before we close the session let me once again assure you that we are here to take the company to the next level and create significant value for all stakeholders by delivering exceptional quality projects resulting in superior shareholder returns in the medium term perspective. We propose to move forward in a steady manner. On behalf of RKEC, we would like to thank you all for your participation in the conference call amidst your busy day. Thank you and have a wonderful time ahead.\\nModerator: Thank you. On behalf of RKEC Projects Limited, that concludes this conference. Thank you for joining us and you may now disconnect your lines.\\n\"}"

Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for joining the RKEC Projects Limited Q4 and FY21 earnings conference call. Today we have with us Mr. G.

So without any further ado, I will hand over the call to Mr. Jayachandran for his initial comments on the financial performance of the company; over to you sir.'}, {'chunk_id': 3, 'speaker': 'R. Jayachandran', 'text': 'Good afternoon and a hearty welcome to all the participants. I am Jaya Chandran here. I joined as CFO last year‚Ä¶in the middle of the current financial year. My job is primarily to give an introduction about the company. The company as of this quarter has a standing of almost 35 years. The company is founded by Sri G. Radhakrishna, present Managing Director and it started in a small way. We have come to this level and become a company on 1st April 2005. In 2017 we have got listed company in emerging platform of NSE. Now in the last year December we have migrated to the main board. The company has started its business with various construction activities, small to big and finally now we have been now concentrating on our core competent areas of marine structures and bridges where we have already made our footprint. Even though we are a midcap we have got our place in this segment where we are. We have been ranked as one of the top 10 companies for designing and executing marine works in the country. The company has been executing on-shore and infrastructure project in (not clear). We are also a super special class registered contractors with the Ministry of Defense which gives an unlimited tendering capability of ours. We have a good reputation as far as quality of delivery and timely delivery and the sectors in which we work include ports, defense, railways, private sectors and big corporates, steel industry, SR, any number of such companies we are associated. We could achieve a good track record of cumulative annual growth rate for the last five years consistently except for the last year, the details of which will be explained by the CMD'}, {'chunk_id': 4, 'speaker': 'G. Radhakrishna', 'text': 'Thank you Ms. Astha and Mr. Jayachandran. Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen. I am Radhakrishna CMD of RKEC Projects Limited. It is my pleasure to welcome you all to our investor‚Äôs conference to discuss the financial performance of RKEC Projects Limited for the financial year 20-21 and also share with you our way forward. RKEC Private Limited is one of the leading infra companies which has 35 years of experience in the business of marine work and bridges. Company has completed 95 projects so far worth over 1830 crores and currently working on 14 projects amounting to Rs. 600 crores. During the financial year 21 the company could complete four projects. The notable ones are electrification work of Purvanchal Vidyut Vitraan Nigam Limited and ports like JNPT. Let me come to the order book first before getting into the financials. The company carries an order value of 883 crores for execution as of 1/4/2021 and secured an order of Rs. 134 crores after the financial year brought in about Rs. 1017 crores of orders on hand considering an average turnover of Rs.300 crores for financial year 20-21, 22 and Rs. 400 crores for financial 20-22 and 23. The company is having a sufficient order book on hand. We have also submitted big (not clear) project (not clear) Rs.1000 crores approximately and is bidding for another Rs. 600 crores by 31/12/2021. Considering a minimum surface of one third, we are expected to have a very comfortable RO position, of three years‚Äô turnover being available at any point of time. When I look at the turnover, it is seen that the turnover of the company has suffered a drop of Rs. 95 crores that is 33% as compared to the turnover of the previous year. Drop in turnover was due to multiple challenges faced by the company. The first one was due to the outbreak of the pandemic right from March 2020 and impacted throughout the financial year. The major projects which have suffered set backs are port, JNPT, Adani project, Haldia Project and sea project of the Indian Navy Visakhapatnam. The second challenge was on account of the slowdown in the construction activities in the Farakka Project. The slowdown of Farakka project was mainly due to an unfortunate accident on 16/2/2020 and the subsequent investigation studies and review of the design and ranks by multiple agencies. We are happy to inform you that our clients are being approved after the completion of all studies. The project will be back on track in another three months time after the monsoon, 2021. The third reason was that the company was suffering from the working capital constraint for the last two years on account of the receivable of Rs.65 crores from SSPUVDNL. I am happy to share with you that the contract has been revalidated, work has been completed and a debt of Rs.52 crores against Rs. 80 crores have already been collected which has provided a slight relief to the working capital position of the company. We are expecting the balance payment of Rs. 28 crores during the second quarter of the financial year 2021. We are probably one of the few contractors in India to have recovered money without penalty which shows the strength of the company and its integrity level. I congratulate all my staff who have struggled to receive this and also shareholders for having confidence and stood by us for over two years. While we could mitigate the three challenges, we are still left with one challenge on the working capital credit limits from Bank of Baroda. The sanction of credit limit of Bank of Baroda has also been received during June 2021. Sanction by the Bank is not very comfortable for the company to receive the increase in turnover. Infact the major set and are confident of mitigating it in the next two months‚Äô time. We bring to your kind notice that we have not removed any of our staff during the pandemic and full salaries were paid and the directors have sacrificed their salaries to pay them as they are the pillars and strength of the company. The profitability of the company reflected EBITDA of Rs. 82.94 crores during the financial year 2021 as against the previous years‚Äô performance of Rs. 69.61 crores. Similarly, the profit after tax for the year 2021 is Rs.12.76 crores as against Rs. 27.86 crores of 19-20. I would like to state that the drop in profit is directly the result of the drop in turnover as expenditure level remained almost the same. The company has adopted IND AS requirement as NSE main board listed companies thereby improving the standard. We have appointed a new CFO Mr. Jayachandran who is highly qualified and experienced. He is a qualified finance professional who has got 35 years of industry exposure. He possesses multi various and functional experience in various industries such as engineering, infrastructure, manufacturing etc. He has been (not sure) CFO for the last 25 years into the organization. His services are expected to benefit the company substantially. Mr. Satyanarayana has opted to retire as he has attained the age of 65 years. We are confident of the way forward by regaining the growth in turnover to Rs. 300 crores during the financial year 21-22; by adding on jobs of oil & gas, specialized billing with due diligence and thereby to add value to the investors in the coming years. Our strategy and philosophy of work can be considered to optimized operational (not clear) by enhancing the project execution capability and efficient project management to capture the industry growth potential, to retain and attract talent, to go for (not sure) billing by striking a balance between the risk profile of owning versus hiring. Our resources and capabilities do consists of our track record of completion of projects, long experience as a promoter in the construction sector, dedicated, robust and successful team, own fleet of construction equipment, long-term relationship with client, high quality, cost-effective project delivery capability, timely completion of projects, reasonable asset base for the size of the company. Coming to the short-term (not clear) I should say that despite the pandemic, stringent credit sanctioning norms insisted in banks and increase in price of steel are the major ones. We are confident of mitigating all the above during the financial year 21-22. The floor is now open for questions and answer session. You may now ask questions one by one.

Radhakrishna', 'text': 'Yes sir.'}, {'chunk_id': 7, 'speaker': 'Dixit Doshi', 'text': 'Just a clarification, you mentioned that as on 31st March the order book was 883 crores and we received a fresh order of 134 crores after March.'}, {'chunk_id': 8, 'speaker': 'G. Radhakrishna', 'text': 'Correct.'}, {'chunk_id': 9, 'speaker': 'Dixit Doshi', 'text': 'Okay. Now, can you mention the top three, four projects among this which will be the high-value project?'}, {'chunk_id': 10, 'speaker': 'R. Jayachandran', 'text': 'Shall I answer?'}, {'chunk_id': 11, 'speaker': 'G. Radhakrishna', 'text': 'Yeah.'}, {'chunk_id': 12, 'speaker': 'R. Jayachandran', 'text': 'It is correct that we have got an unexecuted order value of 883 crores as on 31/3/2021 and we have also secured an order of 134 crores after 1st April. Totally it is around 1000 crores of work order on hand. The major projects are Farakka project where unexecuted order value is around 288 crores, the second one is a project of jetty construction for Indian Navy in Visakhapatnam which is approximately 140 crores. The third one is‚Ä¶there are two projects in Calcutta Fortress that is Haldia Dock Complex. Together it is around 200 crores. The next one is the order which we recently got that is a construction of a fisheries harbor in Kakinada in a place called Uppada. The project is funded by NABARD and we have a back to back contract for the marine portion which is 134 crores. We do have few other projects already ongoing, many of them are in advanced stages of completion. One another project is in the west coast of India in Karnataka; that is Honnavar where we have got an unexecuted order value of about 75 crores. So this constitutes almost 1000 crores of the order book. Almost all the projects are already mobilized and work is up and running.'}, {'chunk_id': 13, 'speaker': 'Dixit Doshi', 'text': 'Okay so except for I guess, there was some issue at Farakka‚Ä¶.other projects are running on right?'}, {'chunk_id': 14, 'speaker': 'R. Jayachandran', 'text': 'I would like to clarify that there was the problem at Farakka but at present, we are already out of the problem, we have sensed that. Our designs and everything has been checked and our designs as CMD has made in his speech, the designs are already approved and the drawings are getting approved. In another month or one and a half month‚Äôs time we will be getting all the drawings approved. With revised drawings are primarily providing some more add ons and a few measures as added precaution and nothing else. The work will start in full swing, but due to the climatic conditions and floor conditions, maybe after the monsoons that is September, October 2021 only we can see that the main work can go in full swing.'}, {'chunk_id': 15, 'speaker': 'Dixit Doshi', 'text': 'Okay. Sir my next question is regarding our finances. You mentioned that there was some stress on the working capital. So what is our current bank (not clear) in terms of fund base and non-fund base. We already have pretty much a 1000-crore order. So how much more order we can bid? How much more bank guarantees we have? a cash credit limit of 37.5 crores. We are working on‚Ä¶.as far as the non-fund base limit is concerned, we are very much comfortable. As you may be knowing that after the outbreak of the pandemic, the government has given some relaxations as far as bank guarantees are concerned. Performance bank guarantees and retention bank guarantees have been relaxed to some 10% to 3%; so we are very much comfortable as far as the non-fund basis limit is concerned. However, due to the delay or due to the slowdown in the last year, we may need to pump in a bit more money as far as the working capital is concerned. Presently we have only 37.5. Ideally we should have around 60, 65 crores of working capital‚Ä¶.65 to 70 crores we may be requiring and we are sourcing it. We are working on various fronts only and we will be able to do it. This is required because we are planning to bring the turnover back to 300 plus in the current year.'}, {'chunk_id': 16, 'speaker': 'Dixit Doshi', 'text': 'With this 210 crores, limit and 37 crores CC limit, how much more order you can bid for maximum?'}, {'chunk_id': 17, 'speaker': 'R. Jayachandran', 'text': 'As far as today we have about 14 projects up and running of which in the current financial year we will be completing and getting out around 8 to 9 projects because almost all of them are in advanced stages of completion; almost completed or substantial completion. By the year end if there is no further orders coming to us, we will be left with only five orders. So essentially we have the resources where we can definitely open up three to four major projects in the size of 200 crores; we can at least open three to four projects and we have also bid for two projects and we are confident of at least getting one out of it. So one or two projects more we will be able to get in the current financial year. Our strategy is that to always keep the order book on hand almost free of turnover. The reason is that the average delivery time is also 2-1/2 to 3 years‚Äô time. So we should be in a position to get once the‚Ä¶after finishing 1000 crores, third is what is going to be completed during the current financial year may be about 400, 500 600 crores may go out of the books, so additional 400, 500, or 600 crores will come in. So definitely we can accommodate another 600 to 700 crores of order even with the existing scale of things.'}, {'chunk_id': 18, 'speaker': 'Dixit Doshi', 'text': 'Okay. Coming to our receivables, you know it has gone up sharply; almost 143 crores. Is there any more than six months or more than one year old receivables and if you can mention how much it is?'}, {'chunk_id': 19, 'speaker': 'R. Jayachandran', 'text': 'I could not get you, the voice is not clear‚Ä¶143 you are talking of what figure?'}, {'chunk_id': 20, 'speaker': 'Dixit Doshi', 'text': 'I was saying that our receivables are almost 143 crores as on March end. So is there any slow moving like more than six months or more than one year old receivable and if you can mention the amount‚Ä¶how much it is?'}, {'chunk_id': 21, 'speaker': 'R. Jayachandran', 'text': 'Actually the receivables are around 168 crores as per the audited accounts which consists of retention amount which is payable as per the terms of contract after the (not clear) is over. We don‚Äôt have any receivable which is stressed as of today. It was not the case in the last two years. We had one major stressed asset of around 65 crores in the books from a client called Purvanchal Vidyut Vitraan Nigam Limited which is what CMD was expressing in his speech that we are probably the So I could say that there is no receivable in the books as of today which is stressed, not even stressed which is not (not clear). To substantiate my statement I should say that we had renewed all the sundry debtors on 31st of March, all the receivables and we have found that two of the receivables which are almost 5, 6 years old, we in fact have written off these two debts. One from a company called SEW which has already gone to NCLT and the second one is also gone to NCLT called IVCRL. About 3.4 crores of debts which we ourselves assessed that yes there could be a stress and there is a doubtfulness on the case which we have analyzed and we have written off. So at at the end of the day today we have not even a stressed asset in our books as far as receivables are concerned.'}, {'chunk_id': 22, 'speaker': 'Dixit Doshi', 'text': 'I understand that except for Purvanchal there is no stress on the receivables. But how much of this would be more than six months old?'}, {'chunk_id': 23, 'speaker': 'R. Jayachandran', 'text': 'As of now, there is hardly about 20 to 25 crores more than six months old. That also more than six months old because it is receivable as per the payment term in the contract. For example, retention money held by the client will be on a stage payment. For benchmark completion only they will release the money, that is the reason why. Number of days wise it is more than six months otherwise it is payable as per the contract once we achieve that benchmark completion.'}, {'chunk_id': 24, 'speaker': 'Dixit Doshi', 'text': 'Okay, one last question from my side. This year we did about 15%, 16% EBITDA margin and we are planning to do a top line of 300 crores in FY22. What kind of margins‚Ä¶..I mean we can sustain this 15%, 16% margin given the kind of commodity price hike‚Ä¶?'}, {'chunk_id': 25, 'speaker': 'R. Jayachandran', 'text': 'I think this is a very good question. I think we should be able to‚Ä¶'}, {'chunk_id': 26, 'speaker': 'G. Radhakrishna', 'text': 'Mr. Dixit I would like to answer your question‚Ä¶two questions. First question was you were saying 37.5 crores how much order book can you book? This was your question earlier I think. We will be completing some of the projects; whatever is there as explained by him about 8 to 9 projects we will be completing and in addition we can definitely take up around 600 to 1000 crores in this financial year, additional works of around 600 to 1000 crores in this financial year provided we enhance our credit limit to another s30 crores which we are doing and probably within another two months we should be able to do that. And the question asked, achieving the PBT and all that we are in a very positive mode to move to that extent but being in the pandemic situation and all we may not be able to commit to that level what would be the exact figures and all but we must be earning definitely better than the present year position sir.'}, {'chunk_id': 27, 'speaker': 'Dixit Doshi', 'text': 'So 15%, 16% EBITDA margin you feel is a sustainable margin?'}, {'chunk_id': 28, 'speaker': 'R. Jayachandran', 'text': 'Yeah, it is not impossible, it can be achieved. We are not saying that it cannot be achieved but we do not know what kind of‚Ä¶.. As far as receivables, there is no problems there.'}, {'chunk_id': 29, 'speaker': 'G. Radhakrishna', 'text': 'Thank you sir, I think we answered all your questions.'}, {'chunk_id': 30, 'speaker': 'Moderator', 'text': 'Thank you sir. The next question comes from Mr. Jitu Punjabi from EM Capital Investors. Please go ahead sir.'}, {'chunk_id': 31, 'speaker': 'Jitu Punjabi', 'text': 'Yes good afternoon Mr. Radhakrishna how are you?'}, {'chunk_id': 32, 'speaker': 'G. Radhakrishna', 'text': 'Good afternoon, thanks sir, how are you.'}, {'chunk_id': 33, 'speaker': 'Jitu Punjabi', 'text': 'I am very well. Sir I wanted to just ask a couple of things. One the point that there is a constraint for working capital‚Ä¶..is there a path to resolution there? In the sense the point you made in the last question was that we will do X number of projects and then we will replace it with new projects and we are doing and we should reach a reasonable turnover over the next 12 months. But if the working capital is constrained, that may not be doable. So the question is that, is there a path to resolution on the working capital constraint side?'}, {'chunk_id': 34, 'speaker': 'G. Radhakrishna', 'text': 'Resolution has been passed in the last board meeting sir and we have already approached‚Ä¶.we are trying for multiple banking sir and we have applied for annuity to Bank of Baroda which we will be getting very shortly. Two or three banks are ready to process and issue the working capital.'}, {'chunk_id': 35, 'speaker': 'Jitu Punjabi', 'text': 'Okay, good‚Ä¶.I mean in the next few months that should be resolved, is the point you are making.'}, {'chunk_id': 36, 'speaker': 'G. Radhakrishna', 'text': 'I think in the next two months it will be resolved, that‚Äôs what we are hoping now. Anyway the next two months are also the monsoon period and we may not be able to progress much on the work, by that time we will try to get the capital and in the next six months we will try and do a good amount of job in the next six months. In the third and fourth quarter we will be doing a good amount of job.'}, {'chunk_id': 37, 'speaker': 'Jitu Punjabi', 'text': 'Okay so we should be able to catch up on the business side?'}, {'chunk_id': 38, 'speaker': 'G. Radhakrishna', 'text': 'Yes sir. We are very confident now when compared to the last year. You must be knowing of our stress on Purvanchal‚Ä¶.I was giving you all the information whatever is there. Now we are very confident of getting out of that.'}, {'chunk_id': 39, 'speaker': 'Jitu Punjabi', 'text': 'Tell me is there any further receivable beside the 15% holding money is there? Any outstanding from Purvanchal corporation today?'}, {'chunk_id': 40, 'speaker': 'G. Radhakrishna', 'text': 'Yeah we have received around 52 crores out of 80 crores sir and 28 crores is still the balance.'}, {'chunk_id': 41, 'speaker': 'Jitu Punjabi', 'text': 'And what is the time line of getting that now?'}, {'chunk_id': 42, 'speaker': 'G. Radhakrishna', 'text': 'Maybe in this quarter we should be able to get it sir.'}, {'chunk_id': 43, 'speaker': 'G. Radhakrishna', 'text': 'Not full money, we are supposed to get around 12 crores, last month which we didn‚Äôt get. May be this week or next week we should be getting it and the balance they promised by this month end or maybe by this quarter end we should be able to get the balance sir.'}, {'chunk_id': 44, 'speaker': 'Jitu Punjabi', 'text': 'Okay, wonderful. Then my other question is that, you have been through a very difficult two years. You are just coming out of it. As you come out of it, what do you think the next two, three, four years can look like? Do you think you can scale up significantly to 4000 crores turnover? I don‚Äôt know what‚Ä¶.is a significant scale up from here possible as you see the next few years ahead?'}, {'chunk_id': 45, 'speaker': 'G. Radhakrishna', 'text': 'Sir this is a very good question sir. I think I have been answering this right from my investor‚Äôs meeting in Bombay somewhere around 2017. We have been saying that at the time when we go to the public our turnover was around 100 to 150 crores and I said we will go up to 300 to 400, stabilize this for about three years and then move on for further. The main‚Ä¶.basic reason why we want to go like that is, I want to develop my own strength of staff with me rather than scaling up so much projects higher, getting people from outside, we do not understand what is on their mind; by the time we understand their mind, the project is over and we may be either this side or that side. So I want to have a very stable and strong foundation by making (not sure) at the range of 300 to 400 crores, stabilize for three years, develop the fresh talent from the people we have taken up and then give them more projects in the future coming over here. So maybe around 300 to 500 we will stabilize in the three years and then afterwards we will scale upto 1000 crores. This is our plan actually.'}, {'chunk_id': 46, 'speaker': 'Jitu Punjabi', 'text': 'Okay wonderful. In the current‚Ä¶.lesser than 18 months, I am assuming capital was a constraint and that is getting solved for in terms of debt lines of credit; the receivables are an issue and that is getting resolved. Do you see any other‚Ä¶.and you seem to be sitting on a pretty good order book. Is there any other constraint that you envisage over the next 18 months to achieve the growth objectives?'}, {'chunk_id': 47, 'speaker': 'G. Radhakrishna', 'text': 'I don‚Äôt feel there is any constraint sir. The only constraint that we are facing as of now is on the steel‚Ä¶..there is no material available in the market because of this pandemic, increase in diesel prices or non-availability of raw materials in the steel industry we are facing a little bit of constraint; I think probably this should be resolved very shortly sir.'}, {'chunk_id': 48, 'speaker': 'Jitu Punjabi', 'text': 'Okay wonderful sir. Our good wishes are with you. Thank you.'}, {'chunk_id': 49, 'speaker': 'G. Radhakrishna', 'text': 'Thank you very much sir.'}, {'chunk_id': 50, 'speaker': 'Moderator', 'text': 'Thank you sir. The next question comes from Mr. Nikhil Shah from Ubhed Trading LLP. Please go ahead sir.'}, {'chunk_id': 51, 'speaker': 'Nikhil Shah', 'text': 'Thank you very much. Am I audible?'}, {'chunk_id': 52, 'speaker': 'G. Radhakrishna', 'text': 'Yes. mentioned as 42 crores; whereas in the annual report it is mentioned as 28 because I think there is a one-time GST cost of 13.3 crores which was mentioned as exceptional item; so is this just a kind of‚Ä¶.how should I read this 42 crores of FY20 number?'}, {'chunk_id': 53, 'speaker': 'R. Jayachandran', 'text': 'I understand that your question is that there is an abnormal expenditure on account of GST in the year 1920, yes it is a fact that we had an abnormal expenditure of GST in the year 1920 to the extent of 13.3. My only answer in that is, that every year there is something or the other abnormalities or uncertainties do capture. So probably I think once you compare 28 should be as a (not sure) when we compare one to one even though it is a bit abnormal. Current year we have got some increase in price of steel which is not fully captured in the escalation formulae in the contract. So something or the other keeps on happening. Only thing is 1920 it was slightly on the higher side, that‚Äôs it.'}, {'chunk_id': 54, 'speaker': 'Nikhil Shah', 'text': 'No, no my question is not that sir. My question is there is the annual report figure and the table of results which was released yesterday, the profit after tax for FY20 is different. My question is that.'}, {'chunk_id': 55, 'speaker': 'G. Radhakrishna', 'text': 'It cannot vary.'}, {'chunk_id': 56, 'speaker': 'Nikhil Shah', 'text': 'Yeah you can cross-check for that. I will wait for that. My second question is, if you look at the operating margin and I am defining operating margin as sales minus cost of materials, construction expenses and changes in inventory. If I take this as your operating margin, it has been shrinking over the last four years and of course may be FY21 is not a comparison so to speak; but the trend has been that it is shrinking. So how do we see this going forward? Is it that a function of that as the turnover increases the margin will shrink? Is that the perspective here?'}, {'chunk_id': 57, 'speaker': 'R. Jayachandran', 'text': 'Yeah, if you look at‚Ä¶.if it is a mix of all in the sense that different contracts we operate at different margin. The overall margin has not shrunken. Overall margin remained almost the same. So the individual projects, dominant projects, suppose if I do X projects which is having 15% or 20 % margin, and that project was the dominant turnover in that particular year that precisely is at a better positioning and it consumes maybe more material; some projects consume more labor. So it is not a very‚Ä¶.unlike a manufacturing unit, it is individual contract conditions and the pricing, bidding‚Ä¶all those things matter actually. But overall I am clear that there is no shrinking in the profitability except for 20-21.'}, {'chunk_id': 58, 'speaker': 'G. Radhakrishna', 'text': 'In short if I were to answer your question it is yes, sir. As we keep on increasing our turnover there is a possibility of reduction of the percentage of the profit.'}, {'chunk_id': 59, 'speaker': 'Nikhil Shah', 'text': 'Okay, but what you said is in the one to two years, you don‚Äôt expect the EBITDA margins to drop substantially right?'}, {'chunk_id': 60, 'speaker': 'G. Radhakrishna', 'text': 'Yes, it will not drop sir. We are telling you right from the beginning we are very strong in making our own capex and making our own machinery which sells more than 30% to 40% of cost on our capex. That is the reason we have good margins and there is not much problem in this. We may be facing a little bit of but external factors like pandemic and all‚Ä¶.otherwise, we should be able to do good job in the next financial year, maybe 21-22.'}, {'chunk_id': 61, 'speaker': 'Nikhil Shah', 'text': 'Okay. The last question, the net fixed assets have been flat for the last two years of 55 crores, so do we expect this to increase in line with the increase in the business turnover also or is this good enough for the next couple of years?'}, {'chunk_id': 62, 'speaker': 'R. Jayachandran', 'text': 'You are looking at the fixed assets and the capital expenditure?'}, {'chunk_id': 63, 'speaker': 'Nikhil Shah', 'text': 'That‚Äôs right.'}, {'chunk_id': 64, 'speaker': 'R. Jayachandran', 'text': 'Yeah, definitely the assets in the present level of operations we are comfortable. But definitely depending on the new jobs which we are going to get, we will be definitely going for some more capital expenditure may be to the tune of 50 crores roughly. Around 50 crores we have kept in mind as the capex which will be required. The funding will not be an issue because we are practically debt free.'}, {'chunk_id': 65, 'speaker': 'Nikhil Shah', 'text': 'Okay and the last one is, CMD mentioned about‚Ä¶.one thing to stabilize between 300 to 500 crores and then kind of making the next leap. So how many years do we see ourselves being in this 300 to 500 before we kind of move to the next band?'}, {'chunk_id': 66, 'speaker': 'R. Jayachandran', 'text': 'I think CMD has given an indication‚Ä¶line of thinking to be stabilizing maybe 300 to 500 for three years, the first year is running, so maybe another two years.'}, {'chunk_id': 67, 'speaker': 'Nikhil Shah', 'text': 'Okay thank you. If there are any follow up questions, I will come back in queue.'}, {'chunk_id': 68, 'speaker': 'R. Jayachandran', 'text': 'Please do. But I think there is no difference in the figures which I clarified to you. If you can send us a mail, clearly specifying which document to which document, we will answer you on mail itself.'}, {'chunk_id': 69, 'speaker': 'Nikhil Shah', 'text': 'Okay I will send you the document also with the reference. Thank you.'}, {'chunk_id': 70, 'speaker': 'R. Jayachandran', 'text': 'That‚Äôs fine, thank you.'}, {'chunk_id': 71, 'speaker': 'Moderator', 'text': 'Thank you sir. The next question comes from Mr. Dixit Doshi from Whitestone Financial Advisors Pvt. Ltd. Please go ahead sir.'}, {'chunk_id': 72, 'speaker': 'Dixit Doshi', 'text': 'Thanks for the opportunity again, just a couple of questions. One, how much is the order bid pipeline?'}, {'chunk_id': 73, 'speaker': 'R. Jayachandran', 'text': 'I think we have bid for two projects, the estimated cost put to bid for these projects to government are around 1000 crores. The technical bids are under evaluation and we expect in a months‚Äô time we will know where we stand. In one These are the two bids we have already submitted and as CMD has mentioned in his speech, we are also working on bidding for some more projects of around 600 crores.'}, {'chunk_id': 74, 'speaker': 'Dixit Doshi', 'text': 'Okay. Just a last question, whatever order we had currently under execution almost 1000 crores, are these projects on a fixed price basis? I mean let‚Äôs say, steel, cement and all these prices went up even further, can we pass on to the customer or it‚Äôs a fixed price project?'}, {'chunk_id': 75, 'speaker': 'R. Jayachandran', 'text': 'Almost all the contracts are either on EPC or BOT basis and on all the contracts there is a provision for escalation. How far the escalation will take care of these abnormal market situation and how far these abnormal market situation prevails is again a guess of everybody. But we feel that this will be a short-term phenomena and will not be persisting for a long time. Hopefully, I think we will be having a slight impact on this, but we have also represented to the clients that there is an abnormal increase so we may have to be compensated suitably. It is only a petition so let us see if it is not persisting for a long time, probably we may not be much affected.'}, {'chunk_id': 76, 'speaker': 'Dixit Doshi', 'text': 'Okay sir, that‚Äôs it from my side, thanks.'}, {'chunk_id': 77, 'speaker': 'Moderator', 'text': 'Thank you sir.

Please go ahead sir.'}, {'chunk_id': 78, 'speaker': 'Munish Kumar', 'text': 'Good afternoon Mr. Radhakrishna. I was hearing you. My compliments to you on ensuring that all your employees were paid their salaries during the pandemic, signs of a really good company; thank you. My question is‚Ä¶.a couple of questions. What was the impact of the second wave on your quarter one performance? Also I am very curious to know is there an impact of Farakka incident on the future orders from NHAI? Over to you sir.'}, {'chunk_id': 79, 'speaker': 'G. Radhakrishna', 'text': 'Yes impact of the second wave is a little bit higher sir and we are sorry to inform you that we have lost 5 to 6 of our employees and one or two sub- contractors also and we are very pained by that and most of our people are demoralized by the pandemic situation. But the way we have looked after all the staff and all the staff have been covered by insurance even if these people got affected, they have got an extra benefit of Rs.10,00,000 as insurance benefit for them in addition to the PF of Rs.7,00,000 or something. So all people are taken care of and I am sure my strength is our staff which I looked after well and we will be able to cover up whatever backlog we are having in the second wave of pandemic‚Ä¶.we should be able to cover it up in the future. There is no problem from our side.'}, {'chunk_id': 80, 'speaker': 'Munish Kumar', 'text': 'Okay sir and what is the impact of this Farakka incident on any future orders from NHAI?'}, {'chunk_id': 81, 'speaker': 'R. Jayachandran', 'text': 'As far as Farakka incident is concerned, we had already clarified and CMD also made in his speech that we are out of the issues as such as far as the job of Farakka is concerned. But still we still carry‚Ä¶we are in the holiday list of the NHAI for a period of 3 years, that means upto February 2023. But we are confident that once we start the work in full swing we will be getting out of the holiday list for sure. we are not affected because we do have order book on hand upto 2023 sufficiently even as of now even without even depending on NHAI‚Ä¶further jobs at NHAI. But our aim is to get out of the holiday list by this year end.'}, {'chunk_id': 82, 'speaker': 'Munish Kumar', 'text': 'Alright sir. Thank you and again my compliments for being so human as an organization. Thank you, I am done with my questions.'}, {'chunk_id': 83, 'speaker': 'Moderator', 'text': 'Thank you sir. The next question comes from Mr. Gurjot Aluwalia an individual investor. Please go ahead sir.'}, {'chunk_id': 84, 'speaker': 'Gurjot Aluwalia', 'text': 'HI, good afternoon everyone. Thank you for the opportunity. I have a question around the receivable. If I look at the annual report of four years back around 2017, at that time‚Ä¶.and throughout 2016-17. In 2016 the revenue of the company was 113 crores and the receivables was around 20 crores. If I look at it from 2017, the revenue was around 200 crores and the receivable was around 40 crores. Again this year the revenue turnover is around 200 crores but you are talking about receivables which are 160 crores. So it is concerning as an investor to see that the receivables are increasing so sharply and also as the dividend is not being paid out in the last couple of years may be because the cash conversion is low. So it is sort of concerning us whether the company is actually able to get the receivables on time and convert it into cash so that three, four years trend is not showing in a good light for the company.'}, {'chunk_id': 85, 'speaker': 'R. Jayachandran', 'text': 'Sir we are happy to inform you that out of 168 crores of debt which is shown in the books, in the first quarter of 21-22 that is as of 30th of June, we could collect 80 crores out of this. So the figure is fading down to -80 crores so round about 88 crores is today‚Äôs position. The major recovery which we could asset is basically Purvanchal Vidyut Vitraan Nigam Limited and other customers. About 52 crores is from Purvanchal Vidyut Vitraan Nigam Limited. Further as earlier clarified by CMD, 28 crores is further receivable from one of the clients Purvanchal Vidyut Vitraan Nigam Limited which will also be collected in the current quarter, maybe in a month or two‚Äôs time. This month itself we will get around 12 and the balance we are expected to get before September. So I think the concern is real concern of the high receivables as compared to the turnover, but I am sure that may be the half year figures will definitely out do this.'}, {'chunk_id': 86, 'speaker': 'Gurjot Aluwalia', 'text': 'Okay, fantastic to hear this. I probably missed this. So already almost 100 crores will be getting collected very quickly, 80 you have already collected. I did not know this, so that really helps. And then on the dividend payout is there any policy the company has? Because two years the dividend was paid‚Ä¶last year because of the pandemic company wants to conserve cash‚Ä¶now, again I don‚Äôt know whether this year again you plan to pay any dividend going forward because you want to scale up your revenue? So what is the policy of the company? Is there any dividend payout policy?'}, {'chunk_id': 87, 'speaker': 'G. Radhakrishna', 'text': 'Yes. We already said we will be paying the dividend every year without fail but due to the pandemic and the three challenges that we have faced, we could not do it these two years but however wait for the AGM, in the next board meeting we will decide upon and come up with a (not clear) on that sir. clearly tells the shareholders of what the company plans so that we remain consistent and shareholder also knows that this is where the company is utilizing the cash and what is the plan going forward. So that we don‚Äôt have to worry about whether there is some inconsistency or payouts or in terms of how the company is utilizing cash one year and the next year it is different. So if there is some consistency that will be very good.'}, {'chunk_id': 88, 'speaker': 'R. Jayachandran', 'text': 'We will sincerely note and take note of this concern and we are not averse and the policy will be taken care actually.'}, {'chunk_id': 89, 'speaker': 'Gurjot Aluwalia', 'text': 'Alright thank you so much.

Please go ahead sir.s it sor'}, {'chunk_id': 97, 'speaker': 'Vinay Kumar', 'text': 'Good afternoon to you, my question here is on the debt equity. Over the last three four years it has been gradually increasing. I believe in 2016, 2017 it was 0.4, 0.6‚Ä¶.I think currently it stands at around 0.8, 0.9. Will you be ensuring that it remains under one as we go ahead with higher turnover and profits being booked at in 21-22, 22-23? That‚Äôs my question‚Ä¶debt to equity.'}, {'chunk_id': 98, 'speaker': 'R. Jayachandran', 'text': 'As we have explained earlier, we have been having a stress on working capital and funds position and we have not gone for higher debts actually so far. In fact practically we are debt free once we get a (not clear) no profits, I think we have also planned for a capex of 50 crores when the debts shall flow in. With that the position may be changing. As such the debt equity ratio more or less remain the same I should say. Not much of a change. Rather the debts which we have taken is coming down. Of course it is a game of debt and equity. Equity remaining the same and debt not being increased, the position is that but one more point which we will have to manufacturing of many of the equipments of our own with materials and expertise (not clear) items. So this also has probably helped the company in keeping the margins in place. So it is a give and take on both sides. Hopefully I think we are on the right track and when the new projects come then we will look for equipments which will have longer usage so that it will (not clear) its own.'}, {'chunk_id': 99, 'speaker': 'Vinay Kumar', 'text': 'Alright thank you for the clarification.'}, {'chunk_id': 100, 'speaker': 'Moderator', 'text': 'Thank you sir.

So if you really look at the asset value as a replacement cost, it is not Rs. 12 crores, it is much rose. Maybe you can say on a practical sense, it is around Rs. 60 to Rs. 70 crores as far as utilization is concerned. As well as revenue generation is concerned.

Why is that doubled? And also can you tell me debtors more than 6 months in this?'}, {'chunk_id': 76, 'speaker': 'Radhakrishna Garapati', 'text': 'It is a fact that the trade receivables has gone up to Rs. 82 crores for the current year. This is mainly because of one project where around Rs. 45 crores is actually due from the work specified that is on rural electrification work of PurvanchalVidyut Nigam Limited. The work certified for payment, the total work value of the contract is around Rs. 120 crores and work certified for payment is Rs. 84 crores and actual payment received is Rs. 45 crores. So this is basically a back ended pricing formula which they are following for the release of payments. And practically the work for Rs. 106 to Rs. 110 crores have already been completed. So we expect the position should improve in current year once the work is completed. Because the end of work we should get higher payment.'}, {'chunk_id': 77, 'speaker': 'Ronit Ramesh', 'text': 'By when is that?'}, {'chunk_id': 78, 'speaker': 'Radhakrishna Garapati', 'text': 'That should be another four-and-a-half months from now.

So in terms of the order book position, just to clarify we said that it is Rs. 826 crores which includes the Rs. 500 crores with the Chinese partner and if we execute Rs. 300 crores in the year then it comes down to Rs. 500 crores. Which means that at the end of FY19 in terms of unexecuted order book it will be Rs. 1,000 crores not Rs. 1,300 crores, right?'}, {'chunk_id': 192, 'speaker': 'Radhakrishna Garapati', 'text': 'Yeah it will be around Rs. 1,000 crores.'}, {'chunk_id': 193, 'speaker': 'Nikhil Shah', 'text': 'Okay and in Rs. 1,000 crores by the end of FY19 what would be the composition of bridges sector sir?'}, {'chunk_id': 194, 'speaker': 'Radhakrishna Garapati', 'text': 'Bridges sector would be around roughly Rs. 600 crores to Rs. 700 crores.'}, {'chunk_id': 195, 'speaker': 'Nikhil Shah', 'text': 'Rs. 600 crores to Rs. 700 crores and that is why because all your equipment is more in the marine side for bridges because it is constituting 60% to 70% of your unexecuted order book you will need CAPEX. And this CAPEX will be spread out right so in terms of the depreciation impact it will probably be?'}, {'chunk_id': 196, 'speaker': 'Radhakrishna Garapati', 'text': 'It will be spread out in next five to ten years.'}, {'chunk_id': 197, 'speaker': 'Nikhil Shah', 'text': 'Yeah but I am saying the depreciation impact and the interest of it will start kind of flowing in as and when your execution increases, right? So as a result of this, the impact of interest and depreciation offset by the growth in the business, so what kind of margin expansion are you looking at sir in FY19 PAT level?'}, {'chunk_id': 198, 'speaker': 'Radhakrishna Garapati', 'text': 'Yeah, PAT level we are saying right from the beginning we will maintain between 7% to 9%. See not only that you have to consider ongoing projects of around Rs. 250 crores with us. Most of ongoing projects most of them will be completed. So in the completion we get little bit of more income. Being government companies they will pay more amounts at the end. So you strike a balance between this and that.'}, {'chunk_id': 199, 'speaker': 'Nikhil Shah', 'text': 'Fair enough. Sir, one last question on an average what would be the split of your order book between Central Government and State Government?'}, {'chunk_id': 200, 'speaker': 'Radhakrishna Garapati', 'text': 'We are thinking of not taking any more State Government jobs. At present, we are trying to taking up only Gujarat Maritime Board that is the only one State Government job what we will be having it and in Visakhapatnam we have one small work which is about Rs. 20 crores job. We have taken up because it is an iconic project and we want to show our position in the State. So the ratio must be around 75% to 25%; 75% Central Government 25% State Government.'}, {'chunk_id': 201, 'speaker': 'Nikhil Shah', 'text': 'Correct. So right now Central Government 75% expected to go up to 100% by end of FY19 when you have an order book of Rs. 1,000 crores unexecuted, right?'}, {'chunk_id': 202, 'speaker': 'Radhakrishna Garapati', 'text': 'No, it will remain around 80:20 ratio.'}, {'chunk_id': 203, 'speaker': 'Nikhil Shah', 'text': '80:20 ratio will be Central Government, State Government and about 60%, 70% will be bridge projects.'}, {'chunk_id': 204, 'speaker': 'Radhakrishna Garapati', 'text': 'Yeah.'}, {'chunk_id': 205, 'speaker': 'Moderator', 'text': 'Thank you. The next question is a follow up from the line of Hardik Jain from Milestone Financial Advisors. Please go ahead.'}, {'chunk_id': 206, 'speaker': 'Hardik Jain', 'text': 'In marine projects we used to get advances from the government but is that the same case for the road projects as well where we get some advances from the Central Government?'}, {'chunk_id': 207, 'speaker': 'Radhakrishna Garapati', 'text': 'Yes sir, same. But for the road projects the interest rate for NHAI project is lesser.'}, {'chunk_id': 208, 'speaker': 'Hardik Jain', 'text': 'How much have we charged in marine and what is the interest rate over here in NHAI?'}, {'chunk_id': 209, 'speaker': 'Radhakrishna Garapati', 'text': 'In port sector, it is PLR (Prime Lending Rate) plus 4%. Whereas in NHAI Contracts/Agreements it is bank lending rate which is now probably around 6.5%.'}, {'chunk_id': 210, 'speaker': 'Hardik Jain', 'text': 'It is quite less, okay. And sir, in terms of margin profile is marine projects have a better margin than bridges or they are almost the same?'}, {'chunk_id': 211, 'speaker': 'Radhakrishna Garapati', 'text': 'The last twenty years I have been in marine projects and we have developed our own machinery for our works. If we have to purchase the machinery from outside, it costs around Rs.100 but then if we are manufacturing the same machinery on our own, it is costing around 60% to 70% so there is a saving of around 30% to 40% in the cost of the machinery. That is the reason you find a little bit more margin on the marine side.'}, {'chunk_id': 212, 'speaker': 'Hardik Jain', 'text': 'Right, so that means to say as our order book tilts towards bridges and roads where we are not manufacturing our own equipments and we are purchasing from outside, the margins in the bridges segment will be lower than what we have witnessed earlier?'}, {'chunk_id': 213, 'speaker': 'Radhakrishna Garapati', 'text': 'Whatever bridge work that we taking up is on River Ganga, is almost again a marine type of work only.'}, {'chunk_id': 214, 'speaker': 'Hardik Jain', 'text': 'Okay so in that project the Ganga River project the bridge that we are making we will be using some of our own equipments?'}, {'chunk_id': 215, 'speaker': 'Radhakrishna Garapati', 'text': 'Most of the foundation work, we will be using the equipment what we have. And other works we will have to either buy it or take it on hire.'}, {'chunk_id': 216, 'speaker': 'Hardik Jain', 'text': 'Okay because that is what I was wondering because when you are saying that; 7% to 9% PAT margins and what we have seen because the tilt is towards bridges, will we be able to maintain this 7% to 9% PAT margins?'}, {'chunk_id': 217, 'speaker': 'Radhakrishna Garapati', 'text': 'That is the reason why we are not entering into the road sector, though we have got lot of opportunities. Whenever we take up the work, the package is around 60 to 80 kilometers. Managing one kilometer is far easier than a road package of 60to 80 Kilometers. We have very good control in bridges due to the located projects and we have control over this but when you go in 60 kilometers controlling will be difficult. That is the reason we get a PAT value on the road sector a little bit less and on the bridges if you organize well you get a higher margins because the number of components in a big project is only around 6 to 7 like concrete, reinforcement, bearings, tiling etcetera but whereas when you go into the roads, you have got so many items. There is also a lot of problem with land acquisition, and theft also is another issue. So whereas in bridges, we concentrate at one location security and all will be easier. That is the reason we are trying to concentrate only on major bridges. And River Ganga bridge what we are doing is one of the prestigious projects of Prime Minister of India. He has chosen around 13 bridges on River Ganga, and out of which five bridges have been completed, three bridges are on tendering stage and another five bridges they are going to ask for bids. So this is one of the prestigious projects and we will not have any tax flow issues or anything on this project.'}, {'chunk_id': 218, 'speaker': 'Hardik Jain', 'text': 'Okay and we were considering some of the gas pipeline link projects are we considering any of such projects, are we bidding for those projects?'}, {'chunk_id': 219, 'speaker': 'Radhakrishna Garapati', 'text': 'We had bid for two projects but we have not been successful. We are still trying.'}, {'chunk_id': 220, 'speaker': 'Moderator', 'text': 'Thank you. The next question is a follow up from the line of Rohit Ramesh from Fund Managers. Please go ahead.'}, {'chunk_id': 221, 'speaker': 'Rohit Ramesh', 'text': 'Yes, I just wanted to know who are your main competitors in this bridges segment.'}, {'chunk_id': 222, 'speaker': 'Radhakrishna Garapati', 'text': 'In the Bridges segment I think, there are around eight to nine parties which are bidding. They are the only competitors for bridges and we are waiting for them to get exhausted. Once they are full, we will enter and then get into the good job. So we do not want to waste our bank guarantees and all in a competitive tenders rather than wait and then if we can get a good job like how we got the Farakka job.'}, {'chunk_id': 223, 'speaker': 'Rohit Ramesh', 'text': 'Are there today like Titagarh wagon that give you competition in bridges segment?'}, {'chunk_id': 224, 'speaker': 'Radhakrishna Garapati', 'text': 'Your voice is not clear.'}, {'chunk_id': 225, 'speaker': 'Moderator', 'text': 'Thank you. The next question is from the line of Jitesh Burma, an individual investor. Please go ahead.'}, {'chunk_id': 226, 'speaker': 'Jitesh Burma', 'text': 'Sir, I have a question on our H2 result. So if we compare this against H1 we have kind of a flattish growth, if you could just explain the reasons and how do we see this half year the H1 for FY19?'}, {'chunk_id': 227, 'speaker': 'Radhakrishna Garapati', 'text': 'See in H1 we got the JNPT work. We just started the JNPT work but as we started proceeding with the works and we have done around Rs. 20 to Rs. 25crores job. But when we executed the project, when we have gone into one of the item they have. They have given only Rs. 5 crores for that work whereas that work cost around Rs. 140 crores. So the department is in a fix whether they want to get the work executed through us or call for a separate tender. In my last two three visits, finally I think they are going for a separate tender and unless they execute that work, we will not be able to execute our job that is the reason there is a delay of about six months. Maybe we should be able to cover up only in the second half of the financial year‚Äô19. That was the main reason why the turnover has been reduced in the second half of last year.'}, {'chunk_id': 228, 'speaker': 'Jitesh Burma', 'text': 'Okay sir and how do you see that, because we are already in June, the second week of June so how do we see this half year the first half year of FY19 if you could throw some color on how it is going right now?'}, {'chunk_id': 229, 'speaker': 'Radhakrishna Garapati', 'text': 'Half year ‚Äô19 may not be that encouraging because whatever projects we have tendered are on engineering procurement and construction. So the three works are on design now. So we have to take the design, submit the design, get the approvals of the design and then start the execution. So it might take around three to four months for us to get all these things done. So maybe first half may be a little bit dull but by the year end, we will be able to cope up and get a better result.'}, {'chunk_id': 230, 'speaker': 'Jitesh Burma', 'text': 'Okay and you just mentioned that we are also exploring an option for hiring equipments and we earlier said and we have repeated that one of our strength and the reason we enjoy better margin is because we use our own equipment. So how do you see this mix changing and how this will impact our bottom line?'}, {'chunk_id': 231, 'speaker': 'Radhakrishna Garapati', 'text': 'See what happens is, as I just explained you there is a foundation work and the foundation work has got around 700 tiles. For executing this work in one season we will be requiring about 4 machines. The cost of these machines would be around Rs. 5.5 crores to Rs. 6 crores. So if I have to purchase all those machines and after the work s are over I will have to roam and get only those works. So we may get into problems. We get ourselves whether to purchase the machine or to take it on hire which is more economical for us. If they are available on the market and are available on hire, we take it up finish the work in one season and then come out of that we get our margins.'}, {'chunk_id': 232, 'speaker': 'Jitesh Burma', 'text': 'Okay can we still enjoy the similar margins that we at present enjoy in the existing project?'}, {'chunk_id': 233, 'speaker': 'Radhakrishna Garapati', 'text': 'Whatever I have promised you we will definitely maintain it, no problem.'}, {'chunk_id': 234, 'speaker': 'Moderator', 'text': 'Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we take the last question from the line of SubramaniamYadav from Subhkam Ventures. Please go ahead.'}, {'chunk_id': 235, 'speaker': 'SubramaniamYadav', 'text': 'Sir, any indication when will be get the Purvanchal receivables of around Rs. 48 crores any indication from their side?'}, {'chunk_id': 236, 'speaker': 'Radhakrishna Garapati', 'text': 'It might be around four-and-a-half to six months as explained to realize the complete amount.'}, {'chunk_id': 237, 'speaker': 'SubramaniamYadav', 'text': 'Okay at least are they realizing part payment or something like that or?'}, {'chunk_id': 238, 'speaker': 'Radhakrishna Garapati', 'text': 'Yeah, they will be realizing part payment.'}, {'chunk_id': 239, 'speaker': 'SubramaniamYadav', 'text': 'Okay have we recently got anything from them?'}, {'chunk_id': 240, 'speaker': 'Radhakrishna Garapati', 'text': 'No, we did not get anything.'}, {'chunk_id': 241, 'speaker': 'SubramaniamYadav', 'text': 'Okay and what is the reason they are mentioning sir for this?'}, {'chunk_id': 242, 'speaker': 'Radhakrishna Garapati', 'text': 'It is not the question of reason. See this is a rural electrification job, what is happening is we have to finish all the jobs then commissioned, give the supply and unless we give the supply and get a certificate from the local Panchayat President, they will not release the payment. And this work is in UP, that is the reason you have to work in difficult condition. So it is not a small thing to get into. That is the reason it is taking time.'}, {'chunk_id': 243, 'speaker': 'SubramaniamYadav', 'text': 'Okay. So end of the year how much can we be able to receive from this Rs. 48 crores?'}, {'chunk_id': 244, 'speaker': 'Radhakrishna Garapati', 'text': 'End of the year I think we should be able to completely get the amount.'}, {'chunk_id': 245, 'speaker': 'Moderator', 'text': 'Thank you. I now hand the conference over to the management for closing comments. Thanks and over to you, sir.'}, {'chunk_id': 246, 'speaker': 'Radhakrishna Garapati', 'text': 'Thank you.

      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Shachindra Nath: Thank you, Aman and PhillipCapital for hosting this call. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us for UGRO Capital Q3FY25 Earning Call. The financial sector continues to experience significant regulatory changes and market challenges, particularly for NBFC and microfinance. Despite these headwinds, UGRO Capital has demonstrated resilience and continues to deliver strong performance, reinforcing our commitment to empower India's MSME. We are proud to share that UGRO Capital's Asset under management reached a record INR 11,067 Crores, reflecting a robust 32% YoY growth. Our net disbursement hit an all-time high of INR 2,098 Crores, showcasing our operational strength and strategic focus. Our Emerging Market channel, previously referred to as ‚ÄòMicro Branch Network‚Äô, has been standout performance for this quarter. The renaming of this channel reflects our focus on differentiating ourselves from the microfinance business which UGRO Capital does not engage in. Instead, the emerging market channel focuses on addressing the credit need of MSMEs in smaller towns and many other markets delivering a tailored solution to help these businesses thrive. This channel's disbursement grew to INR 543 Crores compared to INR 180 Crores in the same quarter last year. This exceptional growth has been supported by additions of 74 new branches, taking our total to 224 branches across 11 states. However, while our performance remains strong, it is important to acknowledge that the realization of our 4% ROA target has been delayed due to lower volumes, primarily driven by slower liquidity environments. Despite this, we are actively expanding at a faster pace than before, enabling us to transition to higher yielding portfolios more quickly. This strategic calibration will strengthen our profitability trajectory over the long term. At the same time, the regulatory tightening around unsecured loans has created a perception challenge for NBFC, while co-lending volumes have temporarily declined as banks have become cautious on business loan segments. Hence, the volume in this quarter dropped to INR 372 Crores from INR 615 Crores in the previous quarter. UGRO Capital's unsecured loan portfolio remains well anchored as these loans are guaranteed under CGTMSE, Credit Guarantee Fund Trust for Micro and Small Enterprises scheme, ensuring portfolio quality and reducing risk. We expect that most of the banks will restart the business loan segment in the current or ensuing quarter, which should bring back the volume of co-lending for UGRO. In the interim, given expansion of our Emerging Market channel, expansion of our secured volumes are also growing, which would also compensate for a shortfall of unsecured in co- lending. Despite this, the broader market's inability to differentiate MSME lending from personal and consumption loans has posted a temporary challenge. Despite these headwinds, UGRO Capital has maintained a stable GNPA ratio of 2.1% and net NPA of 1.5%, reflecting our disciplined underwriting practices and proactive risk management. On the funding side, we mobilized INR 1,400 Crores this quarter, underscoring the trust we have built with a diverse lender base. While we are navigating a slow liability environment, our costs of borrowing remain flat at 10.68%. We continue to believe that our rate of borrowing is higher than our peers set of markets. Our given the volume of borrowing and RBI cycling on bank's lending to NBFC, these have not come down as envisaged. We are taking active measures to optimize it further to improve net interest margin. We believe that with continued scale of operation and good performance, our rate of borrowing would gradually start coming down as envisaged albeit at its lower pace. Looking forward, our roadmap of achieving 4% ROA and 16%-18% of sustainable ROE includes: 1) Focusing on high-yield Emerging Market loans: Expanding this segment allows us to cater underserved MSME in semi-urban and rural markets, delivering both impact and return, 2) Optimizing funding costs: As our credit rating improves and our financial position strengthens, we see significant scope to reduce borrowing costs. 3) Leveraging economies of scale: Our scalable infrastructure ensures that fixed costs remain efficient as the AUM grows and 4) Accelerating portfolio recalibration: By expanding faster and increasing the share of high-end segments, we aim to drive profitable growth in the near term. Additionally, our acquisition of MyShubhLife, an embedded financing platform, continues to progress well. MyShubhLife's AUM stands at INR 302 Crores as of December 2024, and it has served over 28,000 customers since we announced the acquisition, through partnership with platforms like PhonePe, FINO, Meesho, Airtel, Mobikwik, and we expect more partners to be onboarded in this quarter. With access to potential market of over 3 crore merchants, MSL is helping us adjust critical credit gap in the small retailer ecosystem. While NBFC and microfinance sectors face scrutiny, UGRO Capital remains uniquely positioned. Our focus on MSME financing, supported by strong risk management practices, a diversified portfolio, and a strategic approach to growth ensures that we remain on a solid path of achieving our long-term goals. As we close Q3FY25, UGRO Capital is well positioned to deliver 30% AUM growth YoY, enabling MSMEs across India to thrive. I extend my heartfelt gratitude to our team for their relentless dedication and to our investors for their trust in UGRO's vision. Together, we are building financial institutions that not only delivers value but also transforms the backbone of Indian economy, its small businesses. Thank you, and I look forward along with my team addressing all your questions. Aman, over to you.\n",

      "Moderator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. The first question comes from the line of Narendra from RoboCapital. Please go ahead.\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (1.0)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Narendra: My first question is regarding the cost to income, right? We can see that this quarter, it has inched up. So, was there any one-off in this or should we take this as the trend going ahead?\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (0.943)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Shachindra Nath: As I said in my opening remarks, you know, it's continuously accelerating its branch infrastructure to grow because we believe that our bridge to a high ROA is a function of how quickly we can expand to our Emerging Market channels. We have added 75 plus branches. As you know, a good thing is that, our first set of 75 branches took almost 18 months to break even. Our newest set of our last 90 branches took only 8 months. That gives us the confidence that we should continue to expand our branch infrastructure and some of the OPEX increase which you are seeing is just a sheer function of that. Kishore, if you want to add something.\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (1.0)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Kishore Lodha: Yes, that is right, Shachin. So, as we have now 214 branches in Emerging Market, this trend is not one-off. This is in the part of the plan and probably next few quarters we may, as we expand our footprint in the Emerging Market, this trend may continue for few quarters.\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (1.0)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Narendra: So, what could be the cost-to-income in that case for this year as well as next year if you could summarize?\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (1.0)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Kishore Lodha: This year we should end closer to 55%, 1% here and there. And next year, it should go down depending upon how next three months pan out as far as distribution is concerned. So, we will re-evaluate it in the month of March based on the distribution that how it will pan out in the next year.\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (0.688)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Narendra: So, this INR 125 Crores of operating expenses should continue every quarter for the next 2-3 quarters at least, right?\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (1.0)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Kishore Lodha: Yes.\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (1.0)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Narendra: And my second question was regarding your secured and unsecured mix. So, what is our mix between secured and unsecured? And in the secured segment, what would be our LTV?\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (1.0)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Anuj Pandey: I will take that. So, our broad intent is to keep secured-unsecured mix as around 30-70. And within the unsecured loans also now, 41% of our portfolio is covered under the Central Guarantee Scheme. And we started this exercise about one-and-a-half years back. So, every new source which we are doing for each quarter, we are covering it under the Central Guarantee Scheme. And on average, on LTVs for secured loans, we are at around 55%.\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (1.0)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Narendra: So, your secured would be 70% and unsecured 30%, right?\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (1.0)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Anuj Pandey: Yes.\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (1.0)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Shachindra Nath: Yes, only caveat is that what generally markets say is unsecured. The unsecured portfolio, because it carries credit guarantee cover, which is called CGTMSE, where in 75% of outstanding loans, the credit loss on that is guaranteed by the coverage. So, the market would not treat that as unsecured. But we differentiate between collateralized loans and non-collateralized loans. So, loans which don‚Äôt have any type of collateral constitute around 30-odd percent. But if you take the CGTMSE guarantee as a form of security, then an unsecured portion of our book is roughly around 18%.\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (1.0)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Narendra: And going ahead, all the unsecured loans are going to get covered under this scheme, right?\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (1.0)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Shachindra Nath: Yes, we try to take as much as coverage possible. We have calibrated between the cost of the guarantee versus the expected credit cost. And between the two, depending upon what the situation the market is, we take the coverage.\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (1.0)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Narendra: And in your opening remarks, you mentioned that the 4% ROA guidance has been delayed. So, by when can we expect to reach that kind of a number, if you could throw some light?\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (0.998)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Shachindra Nath: Yes, so I think the way we are expanding, I think our capacity is now completely getting built out. You will see that in our disbursement number. Last quarter was also our highest quarter in form of both AUM and gross disbursement. This quarter is both. We continue to believe that our capacity built out is much larger than what we are seeing in form of the liquidity. I think that will get released now. Given that the lower growth which NBFCs are showing, bank financing to NBFCs would start reviving by within a quarter or a little later than that. And also we don't want to expand liability at an expensive cost. Guidance is keeping that in mind was to give confidence to people and our shareholders and investor fraternity that UGRO continues to be on the path of its build-out. It is demonstrating both its capacity of origination, its infrastructure, and credit costs and credit delivery. But if the liquidity remains a little tighter or it is coming at an expensive pace, we just don't want to chase assets at any cost. And that's why this guidance. I think it's very difficult to calibrate and give you clear guidance of when it would be. I think we are seeing around two to three quarters of delay versus what AUM we should have been versus what we are. It is showcasing at least a 2 to 3 quarter delay.\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (0.571)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Narendra: So, the main pain point is the cost of funds. Is that right?\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (1.0)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Shachindra Nath: And absolute liquidity which is available in the market for our size of NBFC.\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (1.0)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Narendra: So, the sourcing of funds is a pain point, right?\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (1.0)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Shachindra Nath: No, our last quarter was the highest quarter in terms of overall borrowing. That was the largest quarter. But the capacity of the disbursement which we have built, if we have to match, our costs of borrowing will shoot up, which we don't want. So, we have to balance between the kind of growth which we can undertake given our infrastructure versus what we would like, because ultimate final P&L is not only a function of just physical disbursement, it is also the cost of borrowing. So, that's why it is, you know, till the time the overall market liquidity and risk perception around NBFC in general doesn't change, I think it will remain a little slower. It's nothing to do with us. We are not in microfinance. We are not in some of the consumption led loan, neither we are in PL, nor we do all of that. But overall, generally, when RBI takes action on NBFC, general perception on NBFC is lower, it impacts every player in the market.\n",

      "Moderator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Avinash Singh from Emkay Global Financial Services Limited. Please go ahead.\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (1.0)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Avinash Singh: Two questions. The first one is on co-origination of CLM1. That CLM1 co-origination has been very weak for the last four or five quarters. So, what is sort of an underlying reason? Is there some kind of a discomfort, the banks have or something else is playing out? So, that's one. And second, if I come to this emerging market LAP or a small ticket LAP, what is the typical duration of these loans? This question I am asking because if I see the quarterly disbursement and the AUM accrual, the difference is to wide and suggest that every quarter 20-25% of the loan is being repaid. Because in this ticket size you will not expect much of a balance transfer, what is happening here? I mean if I see this quarter in the emerging market LAP, we have INR 543 Crores disbursement but the AUM accrual is of INR 260 Crores. That suggests out of INR 1,105 Crores that was in September, nearly 25% have been paid off in this quarter. So, what's happening here? These are my questions.\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (0.958)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Shachindra Nath: Avinash, I will take the first question. I will request Anuj to take the second one. I am just trying to see the data which you are seeing. On the first one with respect to co-origination, so as you know, just for the broader audience perspective, there are two forms. One, co-origination as a term. In our balance sheet of INR 1,412 Crore, this is largely our business loan being done with the larger NBFCs and other form of co-lending and co-origination, what you can do with banks. Banks typically continued to do co-lending, which is option to a co-lending, which is akin to DA, which means we onboard the customer on our balance sheet and on T+3 or 5 days that goes into the co-lending and gets, you know, 80% of that loan get transferred to the bank and we get to the refinancing with that. With respect to co-origination, earlier the business loan as a segment was not being accepted within the bank because there was no credit guarantee. Once the credit guarantee came, all banks started doing co-lending on business loan and that's why our volume in relation to most of the large NBFC stopped and that volume moved to the bank and that's why there is a drop and that increased the co-lending volume for the banks per se. In last two quarters, what we have seen, general this perception around so-called unsecured, co- lending volume in the banks have also now slowed down. We have gone to all the banks and explained that unsecured consumption in PL is not an unsecured MSME loan because banks generally do unsecure. I think most of the banks have understood. DFS has also taken a note of that, and there are a lot of industry-wide consultation is happening. And we expect that some of these banks would restart the business loan segment, and one of the largest banks or large banks in the country is starting the business loan segment, so it would restart. So, that's broadly the color why you see drop in co-origination happening, because that volume got subsumed in banks. Bank's volume has come down because they want to do only secured. But as both would pick up, if we see a systematic change of banks not wanting to do unsecured or business loan segment, then we will reinitiate the co-lending, co-ordination with other NBFCs. The second part is, as Anuj said, we want to keep only 30% of our balance sheet at an AUM level, non-collateralized loan. Once we acquired MyShubhLife, the volume delivery there on embedded financing all of a sudden accelerated. So, last quarter itself, we did INR 300-odd Crores. And we were doing roughly around 225 crores of business loans. Put together, that would have become 50% of our disbursement volume. So, we naturally brought down our business loan segment to now INR 100-odd Crore, so that unbalanced on AUM basis, we continue to remain within 30%. The entire embedded financing piece, which is coming from our fintech MyShubhLife, cannot be co-originated or co-lend because that is a short-tenure, one-year loan to be repaid on a daily EMI basis through payment platform aggregation. So, that's why you will see over a period of time business loan to remain mostly through embedded financing on balance sheet and not go in co-lending format. We would replace that with more secured volume which is now happening because of the large expansion. I hope we have explained the real picture.\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (0.517)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Anuj Pandey: Hi, Avinash. So, our average tenures in our emerging market product is about 7 to 8 years. But what we have tried is also to introduce our Sanjeevni bigger ticket loans in these markets. So, that is why a little bit of confusion has happened in terms of AUM increase. So, while in the investor deck, the Emerging Market LAP product is the product up to INR 25 lakhs ticket size. So, while we have done INR 543 Crores from the emerging market channel, some of it is larger tickets also, which is what we wanted to plan and that is a strategy because in Tier 3, Tier 4, Tier 5 towns, there is an opportunity to do slightly bigger tickets, there is lesser competition and we have the underwriting where with all to do that. So, out of that INR 543 Crore, whatever is relevant for Emerging Market, less than 25 lakh, that is being reflected in the Emerging Market AUM, rest is in Sanjeevni product AUM. There is no gap in the sense that whatever we disbursed has not translated into AUM. It's just that it is shown into two different products.\n",

      "Moderator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Ganesh from Bharat Bet Research. Please go ahead.\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (1.0)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Ganesh: My question is regarding our machinery loan segment. We seem to be growing quite well in this segment and the broader asset quality for this is also quite positive. So, going forward, how are we looking at it in terms of opportunities here? And is there a possibility of expanding our presence in this segment further?\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (1.0)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Shachindra Nath: We continue to believe that productive asset financing, we call machinery as a productive asset. Mainline lenders have not yet captured this opportunity fairly well. Our core of our underwriting is to do cash flow analysis through our data analytics platform by analyzing GST, banking and bureau, create eligibility. Underlying collateral defines the tenure and the price. Machinery, CNC, printing, packaging, plastic molding machine, is a productive asset and has its own cash flow. So, when you add in the cash assessment method, the cash flow of the machinery, it becomes very viable product. It is a shorter tenure and a reasonable yield, more or less at a secured deal. And that's why the portfolio has performed very well. We would like it to be expanded further. We are doing average of around INR 75 Crore a month. Our target was to take it to INR 150-odd Crores. What we are seeing is that we have worked with roughly around 75 plus OEMs in India. What we are seeing is that expansion of the volume over here either would require expanding the ticket size or reducing the average cost of lending. Both we don't want to. And that's why we are taking very deep, calibrated effort to gradually increase the size and deepen our penetration. We have taken two steps, one of which is successful and one of which is not so successful. In our Intermediate Prime channel, for the first time in India, we introduced machinery to all our intermediary partners, which we call DSAs, and we have seen around INR 25-30 Crore of volume started happening there. It's a new product. Most of the DSAs in India either do unsecured loan or do LAP. For them to do machinery was a new concept, but we marketed and they have now understood. And we are becoming reasonably successful there. We also have expanded our machinery product to all of our Emerging Market branches, where we did not see so much of reasonable success because for our credit officer and credit fraternity to also learn because they have just learnt from doing small ticket LAPs to now big-ticket LAPs and now also graduate immediately to machinery was not very successful. We are making constant effort to monetize the entire branch channel and multi-channel network to adapt machinery as a product. We are hoping that by end of this last quarter, the INR 75 Crore to INR 80 Crore of average volume takes this one plus milestone of INR 100 Crore, and next year, we take it and stabilize it at around INR 150 to INR 175 Crore per month. So, short answer is, this is an extremely good product. We have seen its acceptability across all our Co-lending partners with the bank. It is very good credit quality. It is a reasonable use and shorter tenure. We would like to expand it but not by increasing the ticket size or lowering the yield. So, within the same band of three-and-a-half years of tenure and INR 35 lakhs of average ticket size with an average yield of 14 odd percent, we will gradually increase it by expanding to our entire network.\n",

      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Ganesh: And just the second question, on our Slide #27, which is the gross score risk band. Over there, if we look at the risk band B, the divergence between the disbursed and the non-disbursed defaults is quite high. So, just wanted to check, in addition to this score, what is driving the decision-making between disbursal and non-disbursal because that is quite a material gap that we have identified? So, if you could just provide some color on that.\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (0.997)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Anuj Pandey: There are a variety of other drivers. We don't disburse a case unless we meet the customer. So, we use Gro score as our primary filter and then other policy parameters, which would mean doing reference checks of the customer, calculating his eligibility, kind of property, because property is not covered in the Gro score, etc. are part of the other reject reasons. But the way the gap is, it actually tells us that the Gro score is stacking quite well.\n",

      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (1.0)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Anil Tulsiram: My first question is on your Emerging Market loans, which is a small LAP of INR 10 to 15 lakhs. I think the most important thing here is collections and legal infrastructure. So, can you elaborate how you are ensuring that now that our branches are expanding at a rapid pace for the last 18 months, we are ahead in forming collection infrastructure and the legal team?\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (0.99)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Anuj Pandey: We have a very exhaustive collection and litigation infrastructure dedicated to Emerging Markets. So, today we have about 210 active branches and about 250 people in collections dedicated to these branches. The way this happens is a set of five branches combined into a cluster and set of three to four clusters combined into a state and states combined into a region. For each of these, we have a collection fraternity and a collection supervising channel. Also, for each set of 5 to 10 branches, we have a dedicated litigation domain expert whose only job is to execute the litigation orders which we get. So, we are quite aware of this and have invested a lot on this.\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (1.0)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Anil Tulsiram: And Sir, the second question is on Co-lending. So, just give me one or two minutes to explain the concerns. I have spoken to a few industry experts and according to them, what's happening in the industry, I am talking about industry, not UGRO. Proper risk sharing is not happening in the Co-lending industry, wherein the small players are being forced to replace the bad assets with good assets by the big banks. Secondly, banks are hesitant to enter into Co-lending because of micro-supervision by the RBI, wherein for any default of even NBFCs, they fear that they will be held responsible and they may face sanctions or other things. And you are part of this Co-lending committee which has been formed. So, what are the steps being taken for these concerns which is slowing down the industry growth?\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (0.67)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Shachindra Nath: So, this would be a very long answer. For the benefit of you, I will try to summarize it. Number one, banks and regulators both, and especially the Government of India, all of them are aligned to the fact that for priority sector lending, NBFCs are well poised to demonstrate the credit or disseminate the credit and that's why banks are eager to participate further. And there is no doubt about it. Second, the process of Co-lending has become more robust as the passing of the day. In fact, in last quarter, we took a large number of public market investors to multiple banks to showcase how Co-lending happen. Third, within different banks, they also understand that the Co-lending is more return-accretive than their own direct channel, because at an average banking advance yield is around 9.5%, return on asset is 1.5%. Even adjusted for credit costs, co-lending actually delivers them superior return on asset. Last but not least, temporarily, when RBI said that unsecured business should be brought down, A lot of banks became nervous and gone slow on the unsecured piece of the Co-lending. But they are coming back. We are understanding that unsecured business, which is 75% credit guaranteed, is not unsecured. They, in their business, are lending to a MSME without any collateral. Last but not least, there are three types of NBFC which play the market. One, large AAA NBFCs and AA NBFCs, most of them are on balance sheet leverage players because they continue to get liquidity at a cheaper cost and Co-lending being very hard to execute, they don't get interested. Some of them, I won't name on the conference call, but some of them started and then stopped because they found it very cumbersome. Second is the peer set, which is A-rated NBFC universe. 5-7 of us, which are in the A-rating universe, continue to do fairly well when it comes to the Co-lending and that's why we have a very disproportionate market share on MSME Co-lending side. Last but not least, there are large number of players which are in the range of, say, BBB- to BBB+, banks continue to find it very discomforting to do Co-lending with very small NBFC which doesn't have power of the capital, they don't have their own balance sheet. Rightfully or wrongfully, ideally the bottom of the pyramid credit which is done by these NBFCs should be adopted by the bank, but it would happen only over a period of time. In summary, I think the co-lending, and I am not at liberty to tell you what has been the recommendation of the committee which was set up by DFS, but in summary, all of the recommendations and the consensus was Co-lending is here to stay. It needs to be strengthened. The operational hassle needs to be removed. More technology integration should be done and there should be more support and more widespread adoption of co-lending should happen within the banks.\n",

      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (1.0)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Amit: My first question is on the Emerging Markets branch channel. Just wanted to know, like, how is the typical branch? What is the size of the branch? How many employees are in the branch? And what type of AUM do we need to break even? What type of products are being done from the branch? Just some high-level overview of the branch network.\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (1.0)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Amit Mande: So, your question, every branch today has a branch manager, about 6 sales officers, a credit manager, an operations manager, and a collections manager. So, it's a typically 11-member branch, and the collections guy comes in month, too. So, the overall operating cost of a branch is anywhere between, depending upon the city, which also includes rentals and salaries and incentives is about INR 4 - 4.5 lakh. This is the monthly operating cost. So, the moment our AUMs touch about INR 5 Crores, operationally the branch break even, and they would be accretive going forward. So that's the back of the thumb unit dynamics for the branch.\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (0.999)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Shachindra Nath: I think most importantly, the Emerging Market channel, it requires a level of hierarchy. Every 5 branches have a cluster credit and cluster sales. Every set of few clusters have then regional geography and then it rolls into state. And then it is divided into south and west. We are the only small-ticket LAP business or Emerging Market business which is pan-India. Most of our peer set either are south focused or north focused. We are very prominently present in Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Karnataka, Andhra in South. And now we are very strongly present originally in Rajasthan, Gujarat. And now we have expanded into UP, MP and Maharashtra. So, we have invested both in the branch infrastructure but also hierarchy infrastructure. And we are using our learning of our data technology and how data can be used to do credit. These branches, as of today, do small ticket LAPs, which is up to INR 25 lakhs, and select branches, roughly around 50% of our branches, now we have trained them to do also larger ticket LAPs, up to INR 1 crore. Average ticket size is coming around INR 40-50 lakhs. Over a period of time, while we have rolled out both machinery and rooftop solar, we have not seen uptick because we have to train people to understand how to underwrite credit on rooftop solar and machinery. But our eventual goal is also to do that. Last but not least, our channel infrastructure growth also helps us indirectly in two of our additional businesses. So, for example, in our embedded financing business, we are in India's largest payment platform are now integrated with us through our fintech platform, MyShubLife. We have the capacity to do merchant financing in almost 3,000 plus pin code because of our 200 plus physical location. Same way, our partnership analysis, wherein we partner with smaller NBFC and fintech, there also we can underwrite loans into all the physical geography we are expanding. So, there is a direct benefit to UGRO of expanding our branch network. But there is also an indirect benefit that some of our channels, we can underwrite businesses where others can't go because they don't have that much of physical presence.\n",

      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Shachindra Nath: We are not, but we believe that out of our total location, we have around 50 to 65 or 75 locations, wherein there is a potential to do high-quality business loans. As you know, we have been doing business loans which is under credit guarantee. We have done a volume of around an average of INR 200-odd Crores, which we have brought it down to INR 100 Crores. We are seeing the trend that between the two markets, prime market of 40-50 cities in India, and Emerging Market, the credit quality in emerging market is far superior. So, we are doing a little bit of experiment of also doing business loan in some select branches where we see maturity of our credit clusters, credit fraternity and sales fraternity. But this would not be a mainstay of our business. Our mainstay of our Emerging Market business would continue to be a secured LAP business.\n",

      "Shachindra Nath: We move to the next question. But I would only urge you, Sir, and also the broader market. You have to differentiate between an unsecured loan for a consumption, buying fridge, TV, scooter, a personal loan to invest, for example, in a cryptocurrency versus a business loan for a small business, which is done on the basis of a cash flow and guaranteed by CGTMSE. The entire focus of MSME financing in India, the government focus, the regulator focus, is to move MSMEs to cash flow-based underwriting and most of these business loans, which is done for short tenures, are done through the help of GST, banking, cash flow in the banking, and completely automated. And we have seen very steady credit costs of around 2.5% across our portfolio. But also, given that there is no collateral, we keep it under control in terms of the total volume of our balance sheet.\n",

      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Kamal: I would like to hear a bit more about your long-term moat. I am assuming that this is mainly data-driven lending. How central is technology to your data-driven lending? In other words, what would be the tangible impact to your AUM growth or to your NPAs if you completely removed technology-driven lending?\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (0.995)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Shachindra Nath: Yes, the cost-to-income ratio would go up significantly and our credit costs would go up significantly. Our core belief that, like it has happened in consumer financing space, if you look at pre-2008 of consumer financing and post-2008 of consumer financing, consumer financing in India expanded on the power of consumption-driven data demand, self-employed population growing and your ability to do cash flow underwriting basis bureau score has not exploded the consumer financing market. We continue to believe the advent of the GST, digitization of banking, maturity of bureau, would continue to explode credit. It is not for the purpose of the origination of the loan, but it is making our credit and sale fraternity more productive and our credit costs more predictable. We cannot create a scale and size without continuously investing in our data analytics and our IT and technology infrastructure.\n",

      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (1.0)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Shachindra Nath: Yes, so I think within MSME space, number one, we continue to believe that MSME market gives a significant opportunity to create a very scaled business in India. India's credit market gap on MSME financing is humongous. There has to be multiple players which have to step up and there is the opportunity to build very scalable business. That scalable business, our moat continues to be to underwrite customer and understand the cash flow through the lens of data. Second, we are the only player in the country which has a diversified asset channel and a focus on one customer segment which is INR 15 lakh to INR 15 crore turnover where we have the ability to do a loan of INR 5 lakhs to up to INR 5 crores. We have the ability to understand multiple types of collateral. We do against self-occupied residential property, industrial, commercial property. We do machinery. We do rooftop solar. We do embedded financing. So, our distribution and its velocity is the second moat. And third is our liability in them, which is very diverse and deep. We are not just an on-balance sheet borrower. But we have an ability to partner with very large banks and adjust our both distribution and credit to fit into that, that allows us to scale. So, the combination of these three, we think so, continues to be fairly unique. Time would tell whether what scale, size, profitability, and how we become the top-rung NBFC across multiple product lines.\n",

      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (1.0)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Rishi: So, I just have a couple of questions. One on the CGTMSE scheme. So, I am not completely aware of what it covers and what it doesn't cover. So, earlier in the call, you mentioned that it covers 75% guarantee. So, I just want to understand what does the GNPA that you currently have allocated to that means? Does that take into account the 75% or do you consider it as completely unsecured and you have provisioned 3.8%, which is about INR 120 Crores? I think that's about half of all the provisions that you currently have on the GNPA. So, if you could just explain around that would be helpful.\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (1.0)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Anuj Pandey: So, there are actually a couple of schemes from the Central government where SIDBI is the facilitator, which are targeted to encourage sourcing for micro and small customers. The most popular and the largest one is called CGTMSE, where we are also part of that. What it does is it arrives, it studies the portfolio of the company and it arrives at a premium amount. And you pay that as a yearly premium for the portfolio which you cover, which is approximately 1% of the total portfolio size and for the duration of the loan, you keep paying this premium. And whenever an NPA happens, you can raise a claim. Typically, the claim which you can do in a particular year is two times of the premium paid. So, we have been a member of this and have been covering our unsecured loans for last one- and-a-half years every quarter through this scheme. What you see as NPA, as a good accounting practice, we keep showing the account as a NPA till the time we receive the claim from CGTMSE. What CGTMSE policy does is, it guarantees 75% of the principal outstanding. So, for example, if INR 100 of loan is covered and it is covered under the guarantee scheme, then at the end of the, after it becomes NPA and the documentation and the normal operational paperwork is completed, then INR 75 of that government reimburses as part of the plan. So, till the time we get that, we continue to show that as an NPA.\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (1.0)\n",

      "Anuj Pandey: Yes, by next year.\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (1.0)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Rishi: And one other thing that I wanted to ask, I mean, this is more from a global perspective of how you see the business evolving. So, I understand that the intention is to grow AUM at about 30%. And I mean, in general, if the return on equity is our target return on equity, I think it's about 18%. So, any lending that you do above the 18% is going to come from additional equity raised unless you want to change the leverage, which I believe that at the two-year mark, which we have been talking about, where our current committed equity is about INR 2,800 Crore plus- minus net profit, it's probably going to be about INR 3,000 Crores. And on-book AUM would be about roughly, with the leverage, probably about INR 12,000 Crores and off-book, at the current ratio, should be about INR 9,000 Crores. So, beyond the 21,000 AUM mark, if the company is still interested in sort of building an AUM at 30% on rate, if the market's feedback on the share price is not commensurate with the ROE and the ROA, will the company consider only growing at the return on equity rate? I hope the question is clear because my question is basically dilution of shareholders?\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (0.971)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Shachindra Nath: Yes. On lending institutions, except few deep south of the three south players, except one, most of the lending and banks, one of the reasons why RBI guides banks to not grow beyond 15% because RBI wants banks to grow lower than their ROE performance so that they are not stuck in the incremental capital requirement and they grow out of their retained earnings. Most of the NBFCs, including the biggest one in India, grow at a rate higher than ROE performance. The only caveat being there is equity markets. They give them a pricing power which allows them to dilute further and which is accretive to the shareholders. If we continue to perform the way we are performing, which means on all metrics we deliver, but it does not get reflected into the share price, then which is something which is beyond our control, we would no choice but to go at a lower pace because we cannot grow at 30% because we would need more capital. And more capital cannot come when your share price performance is not there, and your existing shareholder would not allow you to value further. So, I hope the answer is right. We are hopeful that would not remain the case because there is no logical answer why a company, we continue to believe that this is just an inward market cycle, wherein all of the investors are coloring all NBFC in one brush, and that's why not rewarding NBFC which are different than microfinance and some other players in the market. But as the things get normalized curve, pricing should get normalized and allow us to raise more capital at a much better pricing than what it is today.\n",

      "Rishi: No, absolutely, Mr. Nath. I think I understand that point.

Here, I understand that you hold a substantial part of your net worth in the company. So, I am expecting that it will be shareholder friendly as well.\n",

So, the diversification based on the different secured and the different products that we have has obviously given us a much better profile in terms of risk when we see the microfinance institutions showing better ROE but huge provisions these past few quarters. But on a global front, it looks like the company is more like an index of individually concentrated NBFCs. Would that be right to say?\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (1.0)\n",

      "Shachindra Nath: Yes, your analysis is quite correct. I think that within NBFC space, we have four different types of diverse offerings which different NBFCs provide for. And we are in the aggregation of all four for reasons which explained by me earlier. So, there is a Prime Business channel, which actually big players, which are AAA NBFC undertake. There is an Emerging Market business with three or four NBFC undertake. We are little upper ticket size. There is a machinery and productive asset business. There are two, three players in that. And there is a high fintech orientation on our embedded financing platform. We have aggregated these four businesses in one company because we think that over a longer period of time, to serve a customer, this is the best way to do it. And at its scale, all of these have a point of confidence, and you can benefit from each other channel very well. And also, it reduces the risk to some extent while giving you the operating leverage.

For our emerging market branch, a branch at a broad disbursement of a monthly volume of 1 crore and an AUM of 5 crore, not only breaks even, but becomes fairly positively ROA accretive. Out of our total block, we have 90 branches, which are new branches and come in the last two quarters, are yet to reach that mark. Rest of our branches are in the positive territory, while we are adding 100 more branches. So, over a period of being established at 400 odd locations, I think in three quarters from now, all of our locations would be positive-accretive.

With the increase in disbursement, the costs come. That is one part of it. Second part of this expense would be the GST expenses. Because as an NBFC, as a business grows, we are supposed to get only 50% of the input credit and 50% is charged up to the P&L. Some portion of it belongs to that as well. Third component is that as we are talking about a lot in CGTMSE, it costs us 1% of the portfolio secured. And we write it off over a period of 12 months because the coverage is for 12 months. So, the third component which is related to CGTMSE cost. And fourth one is inflation, where normally all costs are getting inflated to the extent of normal market, 6-7% inflation. And fifth one is the branch expansion. So all put together, 38 crore has become 58 crore. It is not a function of one of these.\n",

It is largely because some, as Shachin and Anuj explained earlier, that we have partnered on some embedded finance side this time where the gross yields are higher, but our margins would be to the extent we have agreed with the partner. So that divergence is on account of that. While we have been talking about that our emerging market portfolio is expanding, which is higher yielding, however, there has been some competitive pressures on the other channels, especially on the larger ticket LAP and machinery financing, where Some pressure has been on the pricing. That is why despite Emerging Market going up, this overall yield remains flattish for one or two quarters.

Similarly, in embedded finance, there are partners like PhonePe, BharatPe and others, Meesho, etc. would be originating for us. And they would be taking a share of the yield as part of the arrangement. And so whatever is going to the partner is the difference between the gross yield and the net yield.\n",

But those have not yet reflected on the portfolio, and I don't think they will get reflected. But from our acquisition perspective, approval rates will go down a little.\n",

      "Shachindra Nath: Thank you, Deepak. Good evening, everyone. Actually, it is a matter of great pride for UGRO because in this quarter we reached a milestone of INR10,000 crores. For a company which is technically a 6-year-old company, started in 2018, a company, which lost roughly around 3 years' time, both in liquidity crisis driven by IL&FS in 2019 and COVID crisis of 2 years in 2020 to reach a milestone of INR10,000 crores as a pure-play MSME financing business is what we feel is a matter of great satisfaction. When we started the idea of creating India's large small business financing platform, it was an idea which was enshrined in the thinking that we have seen multiple categories of financial services, nonbank lenders to emerge over the last 3 decades. We have seen very large lender in consumer financing. We have seen very large lender for second-hand vehicle financing. We have seen few lenders in gold loans. We have seen few lenders in vehicle financing, but for India's largest credit - underserved credit market, which is MSME financing, we always felt that we need to solve the problem of credit for small businesses of our India. Small businesses are backbone to our economy. And they are not just backbone to our economy, they also solve one of the largest problems of our country, which is employment. Today, the INR90 lakh crores of gap just not is the credit gap, but it also represents aspirations of large - millions and millions of Indians who reside in Tier 2, Tier 3 towns, who have no other alternative employment opportunity but to go and get employed with MSME. We have been able to contribute to that and have been part of our nation building journey is a matter of great satisfaction. More so, I think so - I think in such a short period of time, having been able to build a business of INR10,000-odd crores, having raised almost INR2,800 crores of equity capital commitment, having support of more than 60-plus lenders, more domestic banks, global development financial institution, having partners in form of co-lending of 9 banks and 7 NBFCs is also a testament that this management team and the support of our shareholders and Board has been able to deliver whatever peer set has been able to achieve in probably a decade or more than a decade. So, our short journey of - operative journey of 3.5 years is really gratifying for us as a management. Second, what we feel proud about? When we started, one of our core thinking and pillar was that India's MSME credit problem can be solved through the lens of data and technology. And that's why we call ourselves a data tech company. But given that we are in the fintech world, which is largely focused on technology and doesn't look at the balance sheet aspects of the businesses, over a very long period of time, we were categorized like any other conventional NBFC. It was sometimes very disheartening. And sometimes we used to get frustrated why our investment and sheer focus on data and technology is not getting utilised. We were surprised that all of a sudden, a jury led by Mr. Ramadorai ex-Chairman of TCS and EY shortlisted us as India's best fintech lender of the year and that award was given to us by Honourable Finance Minister. So the combination of size and scale and probably third or fourth largest MSME financing company in a short period of 3 years despite of broader market difficulties and being recognized as the best fintech lender is a matter of great pride and I hope all our shareholders would also feel very happy about it. Next, if you look at why we think so that the last quarter was a milestone quarter for us. It was a milestone quarter for us because whatever we have been thinking, whatever has been our aspiration, it looked like that our entire franchise came together and delivered to our promise. Our promise to create a large financial institution driven by institutional ownership, independent Board and supervised by a management team and the focus on data and technologies to this underserved market looks like that it is coming together. Why is coming together? Because our last quarter was a quarter wherein, we did the lifetime highest loan origination of INR1,917 crores and vis-a-vis our first quarter, obviously, there was a massive and significant jump. Second, we have been saying that where we think that the biggest opportunity, and the service which we need to do is our micro enterprises vertical, which are basically small businesses spread across 9 or 10 big states where we have to reach physically and set up our physical branches. Not only the ROA creation target, which we have, our micro enterprises vertical is the key pillar to that, but more so the power of the execution, number of branches, which we have added and how they have delivered was a matter of great satisfaction. So our target of 250 locations by end of this year and 400 locations by end of next year looks possible. Why I've I emphasized because sometimes, it looks very simply that you open the branch and you deliver a lower volume, but it is a fairly complex process. For us to find a geography where we could do business, find right set of people and automate and design credit to a local cluster and combine with the power of our data analytics is a very complex process. But the learning curve of our first 25 branches, then the second 50 branches is more or less over. Now it is a templated exercise. We know the 400 geographies where we have to expand, we know how to hire and train our teams, and we know that how in shorter period of time, we can become profitable, and that is coming in play. And third is those who track us, and those who believe that we will get to our target of 4% of ROA, which is predominantly an asset mix change from a 10% of assets which were being delivered from our micro enterprises vertical, which will go up to between 35% to 40%, looks like coming into play. And that's why in this quarter, we delivered INR456 crores vis-a-vis INR209 crores from our micro enterprise channel, which is that we were able to double the volume or more than double the volume in just 1 quarter. Sometimes when we talk that we have to expand our ROA, and this company will deliver superior profitability. Because it comes at a lag effect of when we open branches, when we hire people, but this is the power of the distribution. Where they get fully set up and come into play, the size in the volume becomes naturally to us. And more than that, we have always been saying UGRO is an industry leader when it comes to the co-lending. For the last 4 years, we have been saying that India's NBFC lending market is set for a massive transition from a purely leverage business, it is between services plus leverage business. The power of the liability still continues to be in the hands of the bank, and the power of generating assets and finding right set of customers, it continues to be a prerogative of NBFC. And rather than competing, we have to collaborate. Regulators decided to enable that collaboration in 2019, accelerated that in 2020, and UGRO has been working relentlessly to go and tie up and partner with bank and then create this co- mingled platform. And now it is coming in shape. Not only we have more than 10 plus co- lending and co-origination partners, but the real volume throughput has also started coming. And that's why we have highest ever co-lending volume in the last quarter, which was INR650-odd crores. Last but not least, besides our rating upgrade, which happened in last quarter, where we have been taken to A+ stable long term and highest rating of A1 in short term, what is more satisfying, that vis-√†-vis is the narrative of liquidity constraint. We have been saying that is for over period of time that this narrative of that banks are not lending to the NBFC, there is a ballooning of credit happening in NBFC. And we're just saying that is not for our segment of the market. Both liability side and investor side have to differentiate between NBFCs like UGRO which are focused on productive financing, which is MSME financing versus retail credit, consumer credit. We are different than that, and we are treated differently, both regulatory intent, both the banking intent and policy intent is to support institutions like us, and that looks to be happening, and that's why last quarter was the highest liability mobilization quarter. So, that's why we say that this was a quarter which was deeply satisfying because our distribution and liability franchise fired together.\n",

      "Amit Mande: I'll take a minute on this slide. And like Shachin said that we've been giving a rather direction that we want to take our ROA to focus in. One of the critical pillars in our ROA has always been the increase in yield by 150 basis points. What is important to notice in this is the jump in micro enterprises business, the contribution of the business going to about 11% of the total disbursement this quarter rather than -- 11% of the AUM at the end of this quarter to reach to the 150 basis points incremental yield, we -- our micro enterprise business, which is coming from 210 branches today, will start really accelerating with another 50 branches coming up during this year and 150 branches coming up next year. So when you look at 6 quarters down the line, we would be at about 400 micro enterprises branches and the contribution of the AUM would be upwards of 30%, thereby a complete product and a product mix change at the AUM level delivering 150 basis points incremental yield. The other businesses are also firing extremely well. There has been growth across all segments of the businesses, all channels of the businesses, and they will continue to grow at a steady pace, while micro enterprises business will grow at an extremely fast pace, thereby delivering our desired goal of 30% AUM of micro enterprise business and this increased yield of 150 basis points.\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (1.0)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Anuj Pandey: The short commentary on our overall portfolio performance continues to be stable. Our collection efficiencies for last few quarters are stable at around 96%. The gross NPA at the end of this quarter was 2.1% and a net NPA of 1.4%. In last quarter, Stage 1 assets actually has improved over the previous quarter and now it's close to 94%. If you look at the segments within the portfolio by products, we see a little bit of decrease in GNPA in our secured business loans and machinery loans and a little bit of uptick on GNPA on business, unsecured loans, micro enterprises and supply chain. I'll talk about supply chain first, and we have been talking about that for the last 2 quarters. We have been winding down our vendor finance book for about a year now. We had a peak AUM of INR722 crores. Today, we are at INR355 crores. And the reason we have been doing that was that, that business was not making commercial sense. It was at a yield, which was not quite an affordable for us. And because of that, there were some adverse customer selections as well. Hence, we started identifying problematic accounts there and started doing accelerated provision. And last quarter, we took a write-off of INR16 crores for 1 large chunky account. We have a peak NPA of INR52 crores. And now whatever stress we had to see, we anticipate that we have seen that, and we don't expect any further stress in that portfolio. On business loans and micro enterprises loan, these are the natural seasoning impact, which we are seeing, and which are very well calibrated. Being on a quarterly basis, do a very robust statistical modelling to predict our credit costs for the current year and for the next 2 years. And we have been telling that the way our portfolio construct is and what our models tell us is that our credit costs will peak and then gets stabilized at around 2% by end of next year. In the first half of this year, we had 1.6%, well below that, and this is as per plan. But as we move forward, we anticipate that by end of next year, we would be around 2% or a little less than 2% of credit costs. So overall, the portfolio is behaving the way we thought it would.\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (0.987)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Kishore Lodha: On liability side, co-lending is one of our core pillars. We have been talking about this for almost 2 years now. And if you look at the progress, we are progressing well on co-lending side. So if you look at the left-hand corner of the chart, slowly we are reducing on co-origination with NBFCs and gradually increasing our co-lending with banks and also our DA portfolio. This will be the trajectory going forward as well. Co-origination with banks, we will try to increase, but however it is a difficult proposition. It will take some time to crystallize. Banks are more comfortable doing co-lending with NBFCs as of now because co-origination has to be done simultaneously where -- there are some mental blocks that still exists. So probably it may take another 12 to 18 months before banks are more comfortable doing co-origination with NBFCs. But whatever the arrangements we have for co- origination with NBFC, slowly, we'll be trying to move towards co-lending and once the portfolio seasons toward direct assignment. So directionally, we have committed that we will reach 50% as off book and we are there. We have already achieved 44%- 45%, and this trajectory is likely to continue. And if you look at the right-hand side, almost all our products are going into co-lending. So our product construct itself is designed in such a way that most of the products are now going into banks and they are well accepted. These are as per the co-lending policies, which we have agreed with the banks. So we are not facing too much of challenge on the other side. If you look at the balance sheet borrowing, as Shachin said, last quarter has been good for us. If you recall that last 3, 4 MPCs, RBI has been a little tough on NBFC lending by banks and RBI has also been cautioning the market on personal loan as well as consumer loans. We are not into personal loan and consumer loans, so we never faced any issue. But since RBI has been warning and cautioning banks to go little slow on NBFC lending. But however, we have seen that in last 3, 4 months, that flow has increased to us, and we could support whatever setting is required for the growth in the previous quarter. Signs post this quarter are also positive. Recently, we have announced a deal with DFC, which is for $40 million. It is not only a deal which should be looked into isolation. It is our continuous effort where we have onboarded earlier FMO, ADB, GMO, etcetera. And also it is for the larger social cause. So here in DFC, we have committed that 70% of the borrowing would be towards women entrepreneurs. So in some sense, whatever is our endeavour is to promote the weaker section, women entrepreneurs. Some of the aspirational districts of India, we are actively doing our participation in that segment, and we are trying to create a viability‚Äôs franchise around that as well. On financial numbers side, as we have discussed, this has been one of our best quarters in overall in terms of disbursement, AUM growth as well as PBT and PAT. So, in Q2FY25, we have done a total income of around INR342.9 crores vis-√†-vis INR301.6 crores in the Q1FY25. In Q2FY24, it was around INR253.6 crores. Net total income is at about INR199.8 crores, which was INR148.2 crores in Q2FY24 and around INR165.4 crores in the Q1FY25. Overall, the PAT is INR35.5 crores vis-√†-vis INR28.9 crores in Q2FY24 and INR30.4 crores in the Q1FY25. So, there is a 17% QoQ growth on PAT as well. So, with this, we would like to conclude our management commentary. We will be very happy to take questions, if any, from all the participants. And I'm sure you would be eager to ask questions on the financials, on our outlook, on the markets. So please go ahead and ask your questions.\n",

      "Moderator: Our first question is from the line of Avinash Singh from Emkay Global.\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (1.0)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Avinash Singh: Two questions. First one, if you can help with some color on GNPA on this off-book and on- book. So I mean that -- on the overall AUM, of course, you have given segment-wise disclosure, that's very clear. Just to sort of idea if at all there is any difference. That's one. And on the overall level, I mean, with the supply chain being now almost done. How do you see, I mean, the trajectory of the GNPA as well as the credit cost going forward? Asking because even if our supply chain pain is now largely done. But in terms of your business loans and secured micro are sort of -- for the moving asset quality moving in line with expectation or you see some increased stress there?\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (0.855)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Anuj Pandey: Yes. Thanks, Avinash. So on our overall GNPA is between on-book and off-book. So currently, our overall at the AUM level, it is 2.1%. And on the off-book portion, it is -- the GNPA is around 1%. And that is primarily a function of the seasoning of that book. It is a relatively newer look because it is not more than one and half year old. In the long run, we expect that the overall AUM GNPA and the off-book AUM GNPA will converge because we don't differentiate at the time of sourcing and underwriting whether the transaction will be in -- remain on-book or off- book. So that is the answer to the first part.\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (1.0)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Shachindra Nath: And that co-origination because we don't add to the denominator\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (0.999)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Anuj Pandey: Yes, yes, yes. So the on-book GNPA looks artificially higher at this point in time because for the co-origination part of off-book, where we have given FLDG. Whenever the loan goes bad and the FLDG is applied, it comes back on our book. So the good part remains with the partner, only the bad part comes in and hence, the on-book GNPA looks higher. That's why our kind of business, the best parameter is to look at the overall AUM GNPA. Now coming to the second part. We have more than INR300 crores of supply chain book is left, which has currently around INR35-odd crores of GNPA. We don't foresee any further stress coming in there. As far as micro business loans and unsecured business loans are concerned, they are tracking the way we expected it to be. The lifelong GNPAs and credit costs expected in an unsecured business loan, GNPAs are in the tune of between -- around 4.5%, translating to a credit cost of around 2.5%. And lifetime GNPAs in micro business loans are expected to be around 3% to 3.5% translating to a credit cost of about 1%. We are slowly peaking towards that. We have observed in our portfolio. The peak delinquencies are happening around 21st month and the total seasonality of book is a little less than that. But more or less, we have seen a lot of quarterly cohorts that is likely to remain that way. So going forward, we don't foresee too much changes from a percentage perspective or a roll-forward perspective for incremental NPAs.\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (0.636)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Avinash Singh: And quickly one, I mean, how is the competitive intensity, particularly in the secured side, both, the large-ticket LAP and micro-LAP, are there kind of instances or rather increased instances of balance transfers in the market or is it like a business as usual?\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (0.985)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Amit Mande: So you're very right. There are competitive pressures but largely on the intermediated channels, prime is that. This is because, these are originated by the intermediating partners. And so once the customer does well on our books, there is a tendency for the customer to move to a lower yielding principle. However, having said this, on the micro lease, which is largely self- originated, direct originated business, the pressures on foreclosures and balance transfers is lower. In fact, very significantly lower than what the prime business is. And that is why as we grow our micro business, we will see these foreclosure pressures go down. But at this point of time, the foreclosure pressures are there on the book, but that has been accounted for in our annual operating plan. They could be slightly higher, but nothing very different than what we anticipated.\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (0.594)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Shachindra Nath: And Avinash, if I may add, that is what is real advantage of UGRO, like if you look at roughly around INR425-plus crores of quarterly disbursement in micro enterprise vertical in this quarter, INR200 crores in the month of September itself, we saw that almost 40% of that secured origination happened in what we call the medium ticket size, roughly around INR35 lakh to INR45 lakh per ticket size of loan origination at a much higher yield than what we see in our intermediated top 30 city channel vis-√†-vis any of our peer sets. So micro enterprises secured, lending either there are lenders who only do this INR5 lakh or INR6 lakh of loan or there are large lender who do only INR1 crore of loan. Probably we are the only lending institution, which has the ability to go to a Tier 2 and Tier 3 location. And because we do both businesses, now in this year, we launched this, that all of our locations will not do INR3 crores, INR5 crores loan, but would also do direct origination of little higher ticket. They will also do machinery loan, they will also do rooftop solar, and they also continue to do micro enterprises INR10 lakh to 12 lakh of loan. So ability to monetize the platform across our product channel through an expanding distribution reach coupled with a co-lending line and all of the products being accepted and thrust of the liability which we are getting on a favourable treatment we are getting from the banking institution because we are an MSME, I think it is coming into play big time.\n",

      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Moderator: We'll move on to the next question. And the next question is from the line of Shailesh Kanani from Centrum Broking.\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (1.0)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Shailesh Kanani: So I just wanted to ask a couple of questions. One, the interest income has been lower this time around on a sequential basis in spite of AUM growth. So reasons for that. And we have seen a good bump up in DA income. So the sustainability of the same? And how should we kind of build-up that in our model?\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (0.976)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Kishore Lodha: So into that, so you should look at the interest income and DA and co-lending income together because whenever there is higher DA and co-lending, naturally, the interest income on balance sheet would reduce. So this is one part of the answer. The other part is that we have seen some compression in interest income this quarter because if -- you may recall that sometime in May, RBI came up with a circular that wherever there are cheques issued into the customer and as long as the cheque is not banked, NBFC and bank cannot charge interest on that. So essentially, wherever there is property involved, it takes about 1 to 2 weeks' time to get the check cleared because of the processing involved, which is fairly similar to every lender. So there, again, we had to take some amount of it during the quarter because it came for the entire first half. So some compression came on the interest income side on that side also. So put together, this is where we are. Additionally, on DA and co-lending -- it should continue to grow the way we are. It should grow in same ratio as that of our AUM or slightly more than that because our core hypothesis is that we should reach around 50% off book on balance sheet, which is now 45%. So incremental, whatever disbursement we would do in this quarter or quarters going forward, at least 40%-45% would go into co-lending and DA. So the income directionally should be into that proportion only. Hope I have answered you clearly?\n",

      "Shachindra Nath: Yes. So Shailesh, there are a few things. We run this campaign called MSME Accha Hai, right? For last 1 year or so, we have been extensively trying to educate the institutional side of the market, sell-side and buy-side, our banking liability providers with the core hypothesis is MSME Accha Hai. We say MSME Accha Hai, and I would recommend that you should go through -- we do publish a report called MSME Sampark, which is an industry-first joint driven report wherein D&B does the macro analysis. We take a customer base of 30,000 plus customers and we analyse the GST data and the banking data. And by this sector we come and present the resilience of micro enterprise customers, especially our targeted customer segment, which is the INR15 lakhs turnover to INR15 crores turnover. I would strongly urge and recommend analyst fraternity that to differentiate between different type of customer segment and it's just getting built up. So what you are seeing in microfinance industry, the consumer finance and what we call the retail credit industry, that actually does not have any direct correlation to NBFC, which are focused on MSME financing, predominantly because the consumer financing, microfinance industry, the challenge has been very small ticket in microfinance industry, what I read from public market commentary, it is largely the over-leveraging of customers, which means that there is -- you do not assess the repayment capability and it becomes eventually a distribution business, so as in the consumer financing or any retail product. And that's why there is ballooning of credit is happening versus given more resilient small business economy in Tier 2, Tier 3 town and whatever data is showing. And because we do predominantly repayment assessment capability, we are not seeing those stresses which are building in other segment of the market, especially in the NBFC industry. And that is why it is reflecting in our rating upgrade; it is reflective of we are having highest liability funnel in this quarter. It is reflective that every bank, financial institution and DFI are actually expanding their liability to us. So, it is difficult when there is an overall negative narrative about NBFC and ballooning of stress building up on the credit side and retail credit, to stand out and say we are different, sometimes it's difficult to absorb. But I would urge that data should be looked at and that people like us, not just UGRO, by other entities involved in similar type of businesses would show a remarkably different performance, both on growth as well as on credit performance.

      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (0.998)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Kishore Lodha: So it is -- rate cut is on the cards. If you look at internationally, the inflation has been cooling off and ECB, FED etcetera, everyone has reduced it. So sooner or later, we will also see rate cuts here. But as far as UGRO is concerned, we will definitely see some amount of rate reduction. But we think that it may still go up by about 5 basis points for the next 2, 3 months, and then it will start settling down. And then from Q1, definitely, it should go down. It can happen earlier also, depending on how RBI deals in next monetary policies. But we are extremely confident that with or without RBI reducing it, from Q1 next year, we will definitely see a downside in terms of ROIs.\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (0.94)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Shachindra Nath: And as we have said that we look at our ROA targets for next 6 to 8, 10 quarters, we have projected that we'll have a total cost of borrowing reduction of 75 basis points. We are confident with our capital raise of INR1,265 crores, which -- in the current year and added around INR500 crores to our net worth. When our borrowings would convert, our capital adequacy would again go back at a higher level. We will have much sizably scalable business operation. And more importantly, the profitability of company would double from where we are today. And in that scenario, it is natural, and we are hopeful that both we'll have better rating from what we have today, and that maturity of our business would allow us to be in a better negotiating position to get a better rate from all of our lending institutions. I think right now, we have not seen the direct benefit of rating upgrade into our product pricing, but we have seen an incremental capacity of borrowing. So we have been able to sustain and maintain a very high level of inflow of debt capital into us that has allowed us to grow at a pace which we are growing, but we have not seen real advantage of that. But as the liability funnel keep increasing, which means that we have better ability to negotiate the prices, rates will start going down.\n",

      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (1.0)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Narendra Khuthia: Congratulations on a great set of numbers. So sir, my question is regarding our target of 4% ROA by FY26, okay? So given that we are currently at around 2% ROAs, it is kind of a steep task to go to that 4% of ROA. So when do we see the actual ramp-up towards this target, if you could throw some light on that?\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (0.944)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Shachindra Nath: Sure, sir. And giving that kind of a hard number, it is reflective of our confidence of what we intend to deliver and how we will deliver that. But also there are external circumstances which we have to be always conscious of. The reason why we give that kind of a number because to some extent, it is a state of aspiration which we want to set for ourselves, and that's why we always like to what we give it to our Board, is what we want to give to the market. Our target is off to get to a 4% of ROA on a steady state basis as we exit FY26 is a sequential target. We would like it to be delivered gradually on every quarter basis. This target of 4% ROA is a direct function of how our micro enterprises branches would expand. So the bridge is simple. We were roughly around INR100 crores of monthly disbursal when we exited FY24. We are at INR200 crores of monthly disbursal right now as of September. We have expanded our physical location from around 75 to now around 165 or 170 in total -- 210. We would go to 250 by end of this year and around 400 next year. So the trick is that actually, we have seen very good productivity performance as per our target. Our first set of 25 branches actually broke even in 18 months, second 50 branches broke even in 14 months. Our target of this set of branches is between 9 to 12 months. We are seeing a 12- month of target of these branches getting breakeven. So we are hopeful that our learning which we had in the last 2-3 years, would come in play. And as we keep increasing our number of branches, the funnel of higher yielding micro secured business would keep adding to our ROA creation. So as we exit the FY26, and if we happen to achieve this asset mix of 35% odd of our total portfolio to be contributed our micro enterprises, we will surely hit the 4% ROA. And we are very, very committed and working 24x7 to deliver that. And hopefully, you will monitor it up and keep us at task as to that target.\n",

      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (1.0)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Kishore Lodha: So I always say that we will be comfortable at 7x, 8x leverage as well, provided the lenders are ready. So jokes apart, this is on the lighter note. We think that we can -- with the maturity of business and the kind of capital we have the capacity to lever ourselves up to 5x. So .5x would be a realistic one in next 12 to 18 months' time. But with this capital coming in, we can aspire for 5x leverage as well.\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (0.729)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Shachindra Nath: And I would add -- for any medium- to long-term investors, if you look at broader credit market, banking system in India, generally are at a return on asset of around 1.5%. It ranges from 0.8% to 1.8% or 2%, but largely between -- the median range would be 1.2%. But ROEs are in the range of 18-odd percent because banks are highly leveraged institutions. Now there are 2 sets of NBFCs, highly levered NBFC which are AAA rated, which have been in existence for a very long period of time. They also return on asset is around 3%, but leverage is again 6x plus. That's why there is a high ROE. What we are promising that we will get to a good ROA profile and our leverage in the medium term would still remain low, but we have offset that by an off-balance sheet asset and co-lending. But as the business would mature and you will get longer term, we would also get benefit of the leverage. So, a combination of our off-balance sheet, co-lending and when we get to better leverage, then this platform would deliver very superlative financial performance. So that's the hope. But obviously, as a builder of an institution, we keep everything in mind what we have to build, not for today, not for a quarter, but for many number of years to come, but simultaneously to satisfy the need of quarter-on-quarter. So, we balance the both, but we are very long-term oriented in terms of what we are building.\n",

      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Anil Tulsiram: Congratulations on achieving INR10,000 crores milestone. Yes, all my questions are on micro enterprise loans. So first is how do you ensure these micro enterprise customers are not overleveraging themselves? So, where I'm coming from is, I understand we do underwriting at the individual level and the husband, wife and the kids may borrow again in their own name and the household may become over-leveraged. So how do you ensure this doesn't happen?\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (0.999)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Anuj Pandey: Sir, I think you are confusing between microfinance and micro enterprises. We don't consider household income at all. We only consider business income. So, our end borrower is always an entity. It's a micro enterprise. We take the entity's reporting income as well as in case if he is dealing in liquid cash, we also add that liquidity income back. And we don't lend to new-to- credit customers. So, we also have with bureau and in the last 12 months' banking. So, this is the way we calculate eligibility, his overall obligations. And hence, overall, his debt is very much analyzed before we give an offer.\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (1.0)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Anil Tulsiram: Got it. Sir, second question is we are planning to scale up branches from 75 a year back to 400 by FY '26. So how do we ensure that we maintain consistent underwriting standards across all branches given how intensive the operating process is and given the high attrition of staff turnover and the operational complexity?\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (0.628)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Anuj Pandey: Yes, you're right. When we scale up, the complexity will go up. But the way we had approached is that the core of underwriting and policy execution is centralized, and the -- all the other product policy propositions are templated. And the way a branch is structured is also a template. So, each branch consists of 10 people, five to six in sales, one in credit, one in operations, one branch manager and once the AUM goes up, one collection head. So typically, now we have learned on how to scale up. There are tremendous exhaustive training sessions and repeat sessions across all functions on what we want to see and the documentation of that and the business rule engines are centrally coded in the system, which they access in our branches. So, from consistency of underwriting perspective, we have taken a lot of steps so that it remains there. And also, as a process when we enter it -- so first and foremost, the 400 locations where we will operate, we know today. We did a design of -- a data analytics center actually analyzes roughly around 3,000-plus PIN codes of India, looked at peer set lenders' data and came up with the best 400 clusters wherein the credit quality of competitors are best, and that's why where we are operating. So, we started with Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Karnataka, Rajasthan, Gujarat. Now we added UP, MP, Andhra and Maharashtra, and we know where we have to go. Second, when we enter into a location, while what Anuj said, the policy parameters and how to analyze the loan is predefined and templated and very limited judgment is allowed at the ground underwriting level, but also the delegation of power of underwriting in the time the branch needs at critical stage is not delegated to them, but rather it is a cluster approach. So every five branches would have a senior credit cluster officer, senior sales officer and the delegation at the branch level would happen at a certain AUM level. And last but not least, in micro enterprises, while we analyze the cash flow and repayment ability, but we only do secured vis-√†-vis all of our loans have a physical collateral attached to that, whether it is a self-occupied residential property, commercial property, largely these two, and for certain under products like machinery and rooftops, solar. So, I think so we have reached to a state wherein we are the first of pan-India micro enterprises company. All of our comparable and peer sets are either in South or North, but we know the art of how we have to do it, and we will be able to execute fairly well across the country.\n",

      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (1.0)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Amit Jain: Yes. So, sir, my question is regarding our micro branches. So, we have taken an ambitious target, and we are indexing a lot on micro branches to grow our AUM further. In fact, if you look at our growth in micro, it has been significantly higher than other segments. My question is, how are we so confident that we'll be able to maintain the credit quality in this channel? Considering the number that we are seeing right now, So, in micro, our GNPA is around INR40 crores. And Q4 AUM was around INR813 crores, so closer to 5%. I'm assuming that there would be no NPA for loans in the last 2 quarters. So, what I think is mostly INR40 crores GNPAs coming on INR813 crores, which is 5%, significantly higher. So, what gives us confidence that we'll be able to scale this channel at a good credit quality?\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (1.0)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Anuj Pandey: So the way we have modelled this is that in micro enterprises, also the peak delinquencies happened between 18 to 24 months. And then because we only do secured loans, there is a repossession and then a time about 5 to 6 months to sell that property off. So eventually, the peak delinquencies in month 18 to 24 will reach around this percent, and then start coming down. So the way -- currently our GNPA is about 3.8%, and we already have started seeing success in a repossession of properties. Also, as we expand and as we learn, we keep tweaking our policy. And that has been the journey. So if you recall, our first set of 75 branches operated for a year, and then we took a break on expansion of branches because we wanted to learn the business in its full intricacy. Now that once the learning is there, all the new branches roll-out is as per them. So if you see - - and we closely monitor the early delinquency indicators for all the new branches, which is basically the bounce rate, 30-plus in 6 months and the first 12 months NPA rates, etcetera, they are all within the range. So all this put together, we think at a steady-state level, the delinquencies or the GNPA in micro enterprises will hover around -- between 3% to 3.5%.\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (0.657)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Shachindra Nath: What I would add that the mainline financial institution or large banks or NBFC, the degree of difficulty to understand micro enterprises by state and cluster have been a huge challenge. Even within the listed world, we have 2 micro enterprises NBFCs which are listed, and there are a few more which will come to the market. You will see majority of them are very state focused or too state focused because the micro enterprises cluster behaviour or state behaviour of the customer type is fairly unique depending upon the geography. So Tamil Nadu is a different geography than UP. So as Rajasthan to Telangana. So we took time to learn this. So we experimented first with 25 locations, then 50 locations. And that's why we run 1 business, but we run product policy cluster by -- designed by the unique cluster. So the way the collateral policy in Tamil Nadu will work is very different than what would be in UP and MP and Maharashtra. So I think so the size of the platform, which we have built, and our rapid expansion is a function of that we have invested early or very heavily both in technology, in understanding the credit process, understanding the type of collateral, and then augmenting senior management across the length and breadth of the country. So it's a company in its own. And that's why we're fairly confident that this business can be run at the overall GNPA levels of 3%, 3.5% and credit cost of 1%. And the payoff of that expansion is significant to us.\n",

      "--------------------------------------------------\n",

      "Kishore Lodha: This understanding is not correct. So, what happened is that Ind AS have come in 2017, which says that if any asset is derecognized in your book, then the risk and reward has been completely transferred to the counterparty. You don't have the option to do an accounting on EIR basis. If you remember that prior to 2017, when the DA and PTC were quite in existence as it exists now. At that time, the accounting on DA was also on EIR. But post 2017 when NBFCs were to migrate to Ind AS, that optionality was snatched away from system. Everyone needs to account for the DA and co-lending income -- for the lifetime income like the NPV, they have to account for, they don't have any other choices. And in our case, what happens that now since we are doing it for almost 2.5 years now, and where the product cycle is roughly around 3 years, 2 months, so gradually it is -- the funnel is getting settled down. So whatever we had upfronting in the quarter, almost in 1 or 2 quarters, we'll see that similar amount would have come in, in form of interest income had we not done this kind of accounting. But this aberration will continue to remain as long as we are in doing Ind AS manner.\n",

      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Arpit Agarwal: So my question is basically that we have had a good AUM growth, but the profit has not grown with a similar proportion. So the AUM has grown upwards of 30%, but due to credit cost, the profit growth is in the middle of 20%. So what is your forecast regarding this? Do we -- will we have operating leverage going ahead, or would the situation be same?\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (0.999)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Kishore Lodha: So I will take the question in two parts. As far as operating leverage is concerned, if you look at the number, it has already kicked in. So if you remember our data for 2022 our cost-to-income ratio was 73%. Then it came down to 63%. Last year it was 64% and if you look at this quarter's data, this is 53%, probably you may look at it as 1% saving on the previous quarter, however you have to take into account that we have opened 46 branches, micro branches during this quarter and almost 100 branches during this year. So despite opening new branches, it takes time to deliver the operating other metrics. We have been quite better off in terms of operating leverage. So that means then all the entire engine is shining well, and operating costs are going down vis-a-vis the overall asset side and income side. So this is first part of the question. Second part is that how -- you are right that the AUM has grown by almost 30%, the profits have grown by 22% largely on account of credit costs going up. As we are seeing that the complete cycle of the books are completing one cycle we are completing. As we stated earlier in our several other calls that -- our model suggest that overall credit cost would be closer to 2%, we would be inching towards that. While we are making our model, we have figured 2%, projected 2% cost, credit cost. If you look at this quarter which looks higher, but it is still 1.8%. So for four to six quarters' time, it is likely that we will settle closer to 2% and then it should remain that way unless some micro or macroeconomic event happens. So broadly, we are in line. So probably the other parameters like the increase in the yield or reduction in borrowing costs will take some more time to settle in. However, directionally, we are in the same path which we have directed all of you in our previous conversations.\n",

The branch expansion in quarter 1 and quarter 2 is really one of the drivers to this growth, but you may have also seen that all other business lines have also shown their growth. This is typically also that quarter 2 is a little better quarter and the businesses start picking up in quarter 2 across the country, pre-festive businesses. And so one would see that growth coming in quarter 2. Rightly said, this is the new base level for future quarters and the next quarters will be, in fact, the pace will continue.

      "Shachindra Nath: Mr. Bhatia if you have bought shares of UGRO, you are the strategic investor. Our aspiration is to build an institution of size, scale and solve the problems of the credit. For us from day one we got backing of serious private equity investors. We got a global DFI to back us. In last round, we saw participation from multiple family offices. And our aspiration is that the way we are growing and what we are building that larger, broader institutional public market, retail high net worth and family offices continue to participate in our growth journey and all of you become our strategic investor. Your support is key to our success. And at this point in time, other than you we have no insight or no plan to bring any other strategic investor.\n",

      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (0.986)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Shachindra Nath: Mrs. Singh it's a very difficult question for management to answer. While our job is to build business for you and continue doing putting our earnest effort in building and delivering to the metrics what we are promising. Now stock price sometimes is a reflection of the broader market and sometimes very hard for us to understand the reason and rationale for that. But whatever I understand at this point in time, the broader narrative of RBI talking about credit ballooning happening in retail market, RBI commentary on saying banks should not lend to NBFC. And we've seen periodic episodes of few NBFC getting banned, a few segments of the market showing pressure. In that for public market investors, institutional, retail, high net worth have little motivation incentive to call out a particular NBFC and say, this is different than the other, but it is just a matter of that time for any medium to long-term investor. I think so it is difficult to avoid the size and scale creation of an institution which is happening in UGRO. In 3.5 years' time, we have built a INR10,000 crores of business, which has never been done in India before. And it is very hard to avoid us. You can look at us, you can be sceptic about us, but eventually it is going to be very difficult for any one of you not to look at us and invest into us. And when that happens, I think so we would have a very good run on us.\n",

      "Moderator: Thank you. The next question is from Deepak Yadav and the question is number one, when will the SCF be completely out of your books and out of INR355 crores SCF outstanding, how much is recoverable? Second question was the credit cost of INR44 crores in this quarter was the peak and now onwards, this will ease out? And the INR16 crores write-off regarding SCF was in this quarter or in the Q1?\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (0.999)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Anuj Pandey: So on the supply chain book, out of the total INR355 crores outstanding, most of it is our very good customers. The NPA within that at this point of time is about INR35 crores. And most of that NPA is also in regular course of business through collection, effort and mitigation of it is likely to get recovered. So no big write-offs from that is anticipated. As far as running down is concerned because it is an evolving business, we do that in consultation with the end customer. And that is why we will eat it out in next few quarters. Some of it is with green assets which we may not wind down and it will continue. As far as absolute credit cost of INR44 crores is concerned, I think the better way and the correct way to look at credit cost is as a percentage of AUM. We have been modelling that and our models tell us that we will peak and then stabilize at about 2% or little below 2%. So on an absolute number of credit cost, it won't be fair to comment whether we have peaked or not because we are growing and we will be double of our AUM in next 2 years, 3 years. So the question should be seen in the right perspective. Yes, the INR16 crores write-off in SCF was taken in this quarter and not in Q1.\n",

      "Shachindra Nath: I would say Mr. Subavel that we have given enough data point in terms of how we are progressing. So we will not pick out a number to give it to you. We believe that we are in a trajectory to achieve our long-term objectives. When we are confident that our total profitability for this year is significantly higher than what last year. If you look at our first two quarter performance of previous year versus first two quarter performance of this year, we are at a very healthy run rate. So I think so there are a lot of sell-side coverage analysts are there. It's their job to moderate and give guidance to you, but it should be much better than what it was last year.\n",

      "Moderator: Thank you. The next question is from Arpit Agarwal, and the question is in a total, you mentioned four parameters on which you would focus to improve ROA. How has each of the parameter turned out from last quarter?\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (0.999)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Shachindra Nath: I would say Arpit this bridge to ROA is not a quarterly bridge. It's more directional of what we would like to achieve over a period of when we will be exiting 2026. And on each one of them, you will see a gradual improvement, what definitely you can track. So the bridge is 150 basis points yield increase, 75 basis points cost of borrowing reduction, 0.5% of operating leverage and a negative parameter of credit costs going up by 0.5%. So from what was at that point in time, March '24 of 2.3%, it will go to 4%. Obviously, what is very easily monitorable by quarter is the portfolio yield enhancement and that we are definitely seeing that. And that is sheer function of our contribution for micro enterprise business and that has doubled quarter-on-quarter. As we have said that we have not seen the reduction on the liability side, and we have to wait out for a certain more period. And I have explained that we probably have another 2 to 2.5, 3 quarters when we start seeing the benefit of that. Operating leverage because we are -- we're seeing, but actually also simultaneously we are heavily investing in our new branch infrastructure. I think as we see the maturity curve of another 8 to 9 months, that will kick in. The credit cost, we are seeing setting into where the target is. So from a 1.5% this quarter, we saw a little bit of uptick. And I think it will settle down at 2% as we come to near the end of FY '26.\n",

      "Moderator: The next question is from Deepak Yadav. And the question is number one, there are many micro and prime branches in AP and MP, but the percent of AUM is merely 2% per state. Why so? And the second question is ROI of partnership and alliance is 15% quite lesser than micro enterprise. It was a size of assumption that if the ticket size is less, then ROI is higher. Could you please explain?\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (0.685)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Amit Mande: So 2 questions, and I will take it one by one. And I think partly Shachin answered this question earlier. The micro and the prime branches, if you look at the evolution, the first set of 75 micro branches were in the states of Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Karnataka, Rajasthan and Gujarat. However, this set of branches which we've opened now have branches in AP and MP. And that is why the AUM is now building up and it will steadily build up. So it is not that it's lower, it's nearly 2%. It is just the evolution of branches and the opening times of these branches. On the partnership and by alliances, this is the net revenue or the rate to UGRO. The way this works is we work with multiple partners. There is an end customer rate that the partner offers to the customer. And these are the hurdle rates on which we work with. Basically, these rates are sort of 15% is net of any opex or very little opex and net of losses. We earlier also expressed that this partnership and alliances business is backed by a first-loss guarantee. And so there is no -- further to 15%, there is no drain to the revenue. And so these are extremely good rates. Practically, this is 4% clean ROA business for us, and that is why it is at 15%.\n",

      "Moderator: The next question is from Deep Shah, and the question is, where does the company account for income from co-origination? Is it under income from co-lending/DA? Second question, can you please explain the ESOP vesting conditions for the management?\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (1.0)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Kishore Lodha: So on the co-origination side, the income is accounted in interest income. So whatever is the differential interest that we get in the partnership. So to give you an example, if we have originated a loan at 15% and if we have co-originated the partner at 11%, then 4% differential interest would be accounted as interest income throughout the life cycle of the loan. So this is the accounting on co-origination. It is quite different from co-lending and direct assignment. As far as ESOP vesting is concerned, it is part of our presentation, and we have earlier stated that whatever ESOPs are vested in the management, it is linked with the performance of the equity. So if the equity investors make money, then only the management can exercise its ESOP which are vested in there. The next cycle of ESOP listing would be coming sometime in 2025, 2026 subject to our stock pricing performing at the agreed level with the management.\n",

      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Amit Mande: I must appreciate your question because it seems like you are aware that certain micro enterprise businesses, the valuation is in-house. We practically as an NBFC are not experts of what valuations are. And so we rely on the experts, which are third-party valuers.\n",

      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (1.0)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Anil Tulsiram: Got it. And last question is, see, as from the NCD prospectus, around 25% of the advances are the ticket size of more than INR1 crores. So I couldn't correlate this with our business model, why 25% advances are more than INR1 crores. Can you explain at this point?\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (1.0)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Kishore Lodha: So actually, it is not like that. 30% of our AUM is into prime secured where the average ticket size is about INR70 lakhs. So based on the conversion on balance sheet, the disclosure may have gone into the prospectus.\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (1.0)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Anil Tulsiram: So will we continue to do in this high-ticket size because I think even if in co-lending, there not be much spread or income which we have been generating in this?\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (0.998)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Shachindra Nath: No. So I guess, look -- if you look at the total volume of our business, our prime secured business, which is a higher ticket size would broadly remain static in absolute volume term. So theoretically, if we have done, let's say -- out of our monthly volume of INR700 crores, if we did INR150 crores of prime secured business, over a period of next 2 years, that INR150 crores would remain in the range of INR150 crores, or it will go maximum INR200 odd crores. But what will you grow from this point onward in our micro enterprises loan, right? So I think, once the mix -- you start seeing the mix. So today if you look at exit of FY '24, our prime business was roughly around 50%, both between the secured business and unsecured business. And our micro enterprise secured business was around 10%. And then this mix would change, this 10% would go 30%, you keep seeing the -- transition to lower value secured business happening. But also, you remember that one of the drivers, both on the credit cost plus on the driver for co- lending is a little higher ticket secured business because banks like to do that. So what you are saying is that there is a lesser spread. I agree with you, but also there is a lesser associated credit cost, and also, it is also a driver of liquidity and overall portfolio quality to maintain in a certain manner. So you have to mix -- create a balance around all of that. We have to create a balance around high profitability, high ROA, high ROE, but you have to keep -- as a builders of the institution, we have to keep in mind what would happen over a period of 3 years, 2 years, and so on and so forth.\n",

So it's very hard for us without their consent to give you that disclosure. What I can say, broadly say that we would like to have the -- what we take pride in that large leading banks of India, all of the public sector banks, SBIs and Central Bank, the Bank of Baroda, IDBI, all of them, UCO, all of them are our partners. We have all of our large NBFCs in this country which has been in existence, they have approved our organization and credit quality are our level partners, and we are now seeing the order of big private sector bank also being our partner. We would like to maintain the mix. We'd like to have active 6-7 partners and we'd like to build the business with each one of them. Over a quarter-by-quarter, some would be higher, some would be lesser, but that is all okay with us.\n",

      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (1.0)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Shachindra Nath: No, it is getting more diversified, sir. So there are 2 very clear and distinct trend. So our co- origination volume, which was largely with NBFCs is coming down, and co-lending volume in the bank is going up. It is happening because the segment -- 1 segment of the market which is business loan was earlier not being done by banks, but after the application of credit guarantee scheme on co-lending, banks have started taking business loan also under the co-lending. So broad commentary is that our business -- participation of business with NBFC has gone down, but we'd like to maintain certain percentage of our business with NBFC as well. Second, the concentration with only business with few banks are very well diversified. I think so over a period of next few quarters, no bank would be more -- the bank or an NBFC would be more than 25% of our total co-lending volume.\n",

So I would urge all of you when they do the coverages, when they do the quarterly analysis, please look at and read with them and take a mean of that. And they are more appropriate. We have deep conviction and commitment of what we are building, and we continue to do that.

      "Shachindra Nath: Thank you. Avinash. Good evening, everyone. This is not just the year end quarterly result presentation. Obviously, we have done as per our plan for the quarter, but we believe this is a momentous occasion in our life cycle. As you'll all remember, UGRO is a 5 year old organization. It started as a first listed Startup on 5th July, 2018. This company was born with a combination of 4 private equity investors coming together along with me, and we capitalized this company to the tune of almost 950 but we suffered immediately. Post our capital raise, the crisis of ILFS, the DHFL and Yes. Bank happened. April 2019 to March 2020 was our first year of business. We deployed our equity capital of 850 odd crore into the markets. and then suffered. Covid period was a time of reckoning, and we use that time to build the scale and size aspiration of ours. Pre covid, this company had 120 people and post covid, it employed almost 1,500+. We put massive digital and data analytics infrastructure. We put physical infrastructure at 100+ location, and we brought a large number of lenders on balance sheet, and we created a very massive capacity of AUM ending FY22 at ~3,000 Crores. In FY23 we were at 6,000 crores, and in FY24 we have ended at ~Rs 9,050 crores. Our operating leverage played off from 15 crores PAT in FY22 to 40 odd crores last year to almost 120 crores this year. What changed for us that we took a call to raise this proportionate capital to augment our growth? We have been trying to bring stability to our cap structure, and we have been trying to bring unique capital provider. When we started, we brought 4 private equity investors with a defined timeline with respect to their ownership in us. Last year, we brought in global development financial institution in form of IFU which has a very long term, time horizon. Now. to attract domestic capital and family offices, we are doing this unique structure of CCD and warrants and marketed it to large family offices. They came into our capital structure. If you go to this first slide please - one of our existing investors, which is Samena Capital actually invested 500 through warrants from one large fund. This total capital raise of 1,332 crores, of which is 275 crores in form of CCD and 1,057 crores in form of warrant fulfils our capital need for the year, and also for the next 2 years. That allows us to continue growing without worrying about capital and that allows us to get to our growth rate very easily. That is largely on our capital raise. Now, it gives the company the ability to grow without being hindered for capital. It allows the management to focus on getting rating upgrade and reducing its cost of borrowing, and it allows public market shareholder to participate in the growth journey.\n",

      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Shachindra Nath: Second, Avinash asked us to talk about our acquisition. As some of you know, UGRO proposition is following. We would like to service the customer segment, from Rs 15 lakh to 15 crores. This customer segment comes constitutes roughly, 90% of the Rs 90 trillion of the credit gap. This is the customer segment. We service through 4 distinct channels. We service the customer through our prime channel, where we focus on large ticket secured loan up to Rs 3 crores business loan through intermediation ‚Äì DSAs. We have many micro enterprises branches where we focus on small ticket secured loan, we have a ecosystem channel where we focus on machinery and rooftop solar. We have a supply chain channel where we focus on retailer. We have partnership & alliances channel with multiple partnerships with NBFCs who provide the service to underlying highly granular customer segment. Last is our digital vertical. That is one segment of the market which is wide, whose need we would like to service but was not getting serviced by UGRO, which is called embedded financing. Think of a merchant, which is a small retailer near your neighbourhood, who uses an Airtel payment bank, or any of these payment platform, QR code, who buys material for X amount of money, sells the material to end customer. This payment data is getting captured in some of these payment banks or on wallet platform. Now, if this merchant needs financing, then how do you provide this financing through an integrated platform? The financing requirement is that he should be able to borrow through this integration, which is called embedded financing, one lakh rupees for a 30 day period, and then from his daily savings, EMI can be deducted. Our proposition is simple but the technology solution and the data integration or data analytics around this is quite complex. MyShubhlife in the last 7 years has achieved a very high degree of perfection in the embedded financing market. The quality of the management and governance has been extremely good. Given where the market is now moving, the balance sheet provider as well as the technology lender have to be integrated and has been provided by MyShubhLife (MSL). Their tech platform has achieved this level of perfection. They came to us for co-lending, and we told them that, why don't we partner? We spoke to their VC investors. We proposed to them that they become shareholders of UGRO, and their long-term benefit in that proposition is far more profitable because UGRO would continue to grow. They get the benefit of our balance sheet, and that's why we structured this acquisition. We are acquiring MyShubhLife at 1.9x of their networth. We are paying a consideration of 45 crore in form of 36% in form of cash, 64% in form of UGRO shares. MSL would become a subsidiary, and we have aligned and integrated the management team through our ESOP and a profit share model. This acquisition over the next 3 years potentially helps us acquire retailers as customers, and probably 1,500 cr in AUM at the end of 3rd year implementation, and roughly around 100 crore of incremental PAT. We are very excited about this acquisition. This is in line with our DNA of being a data tech company. It's an extension of what we do, and we are being able to inherit a management team whose DNA is entrepreneurial, and they will become part of our family. This acquisition fulfils the need of one segment of the customer need which otherwise was eluded from us.\n",

      "Kishore Lodha: Coming to financials for the whole year, we have achieved AUM of around Rs 9,047 crore which is broadly in-line of the guidance which we have given at the beginning of the year. During the year, we have achieved disbursement of Rs 5,867 crores. Now, we are clocking excess of 500 crore monthly which is broadly in line with what we have planned for the year. Disbursement has grown up by 26% YoY. Last year, we had done a disbursement of 4,600 crores. We had targeted off-book AUM mix for about 45% and our ultimate goal is to reach 50%. We are in line with our goal as last year we were at about 40% off-book AUM and now, we have achieved 45% of off-book AUM. PBT jumped from Rs 84 crore to Rs 179 crore in FY24, which is 113% jump year on year. Our PBT has gone up from Rs 34 crore to Rs 56 crore in Q4FY24. PAT has gone up during the year from Rs 40 crore to almost Rs 120 crore in FY24 and for Q4FY24, the PAT has gone up from Rs 14 crore to Rs 33 crores. That is a significant jump in profit as well, and net total income has moved from 12.2% to 13.5% of on-book AUM, which is in the direction where we want to take this forward as Shachin has explained earlier in multiple interactions that we are increasing our focus on the high-yielding micro verticals. Our Cost to income ratio is gradually going down, which was 62% last year and now it has come to 54%. As the economics of the scale are catching up, it will go down further. ROA has moved from 1.1% to 2.3%, and ROE has moved from 4.1% last year to 9.9% this year. Our total EPS for the year is about ‚Çπ13.39 per share. Book value is about ‚Çπ157. This is not considering the current Equity raise which we have announced yesterday. The money will flow partly in coming month and part of it, will come gradually in the next 18 months. Price to earning is about 16.4. In our long-term vision, as we have indicated earlier, that we would be growing on a sustainable basis for about for about 30%. For the next 2 years, whatever capital we would require, we have already locked in that capital. As explained earlier, our aim is to reach 50% on-book and 50% off-book in the form of co-lending, co-origination and direct assignment. Cost to income ratio, as of now is closer to 54%, we'd like to take it to 45% which may be over 6 to 8 quarters from now, and ultimately we'll reach the desired ROA of 4%, which we believe may take around 8 quarters time.\n",

      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Shachindra Nath: One of the questions we have always been asked, what is the bridge from this 2.3 to 4% ROA? We are trying to explain how this would happen over 8 to 10 quarter, and there are 4 components to that. The first component is the yield expansion. Our yield expansion is a function of our sheer focus on our second vertical - micro enterprises vertical. Micro enterprises vertical is a business wherein 75 locations till Q3FY24 was focused on doing Rs 8 lakhs of average ticket size secured loans. Now that vertical is expanding in 2 ways. We are going to increase that branch count to 150 now, and by end of the year it should be 250, and most of this portfolio of Rs 8 lakhs secured loans happens at around 20% yield. Adding to that, UGRO has a unique proposition vis-a-vis peer lender set. It is probably the only company which does secured loans of up to Rs 3 crores, business loans through intermediate channel up to Rs 25 lakhs, micro enterprises secured loan of Rs 8 to 10 lakhs and machinery financing (5 type of machines ‚Äì CNC, printing, packaging, plastic moulding machine, and now rooftop solar). It also does retailer financing and so on. Now, our intermediate channel, micro enterprises and our machinery channels, would focus on all products together. Not only the expansion in micro enterprises would enhance the yields, but it would also enhance the productivity because now a small branch of UGRO is being trained, designed and monitored to do Rs 10 lakh secured loan, also at least one or 2 large loans, one or 2 machinery loans and one or 2 solar rooftop loans. So that's the first component of our bridge. Second component is what we say - Cost of borrowing decrease. Cost of borrowing has 2 components - 1) the market phenomena, and 2) who we are. Given that we have been a young company, we have been growing extremely fast and our need of liquidity has been large. Our cost of borrowing for our size of capital and rating is roughly around 100 to 50 basis point higher than our peers. We are expecting that because of the increase in vintage and in scale and because of a very sizable capital raise nearly equal to our existing networth, a 50-basis point rate reduction would happen over 8 quarters, and hopefully, some bit of rate cycle change would give us additional 25 to 30 basis points decrease. We are presuming that in 8 to 10 quarters, cost of borrowing would come down 75 basis point and we would see 50 basis point of operating leverage. Our opex to our income, is going down disproportionately. Our existing physical infrastructure and digital infrastructure is sweating more multi products, our AUM is growing and our costs is not growing in proportion to AUM and that's the operating leverage of 50 basis point we are presuming. Obviously as our portfolio seasons, we have been guiding towards credit cost of 2%, we have been largely at 1.5%, this quarter, which has increased a little bit. We think around 50 bps of credit cost would increase. That's broadly the bridge from 2.3% to 4% ROE in 8 to 10 quarters. Avinash, this is it from our side. We have kept the presentation very sharp and most of the other things in the presentation is already circulated and available for everyone, and management team would be very happy to answer questions.\n",

      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Rahul Bhangadia: Thank you for taking the questions. Congratulations on a very good set of numbers in line with what was guided. Question is, obviously related to the huge fund raise that you have done. Now with this quantum of fund raise, how do things change on 2-3 fronts? One is growth, are you looking at much faster growth than what you had previously guided for? And the second question was on the ROA front. We used to initially talk about exit ROA for FY25. Now we seem to be talking more on FY26 exit. Is there a change there? These 2 broad questions? Thank you.\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (0.839)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Shachindra: On the capital front. This capital for the growth which we have been presuming or been guiding for, was required in any case. The difference is that we've taken all that capital upfront but we have designed and taken it in a manner that for our existing shareholder, it is not diluting immediately, so that dilution would happen over a period of time, except that the increase in price benefit would not go to existing shareholder. We have kept something on the table for the incoming shareholder. We would have needed roughly around same amount of capital to manage our next 2 years of growth but we have taken it in the form of CCD and warrants. So, the money of CCD and 25% money of the warrants would add roughly around the same amount of equity capital which was required for this year. Our capital adequacy would go up from 21% to around 29% for the year, and next year, as warrants keep converting, we will get back to the same level of capital adequacy. With respect to the ROA Bridge, we have said that we would exit FY25 with a 4% of ROA. Now that is a function of the maturity of the market, and how the overall scenario is. One of our assumptions was to grow at a faster rate, at earlier pace. But what we are saying is that we will get to that level of ROA. This is why, if you look at our structure, we have given a CCD at 18 months with some coupon, because we are saying that this is the bare minimum we must achieve. It is lot of hard work. If you look at last 4-6 quarters, the cost of borrowing has remained elevated, the liquidity for the market has remained slow. Neither our cost of borrowing has grown, nor our liability has got constrained vis-√†-vis larger peers. That has been the challenge. In this macro-economic scenario, what is being told to NBFC is to grow at a certain pace and to have some healthy profitability. This is what people should expect from us, we may surprise you. We don't know, but as hopefully where we stand, what we see on the regulatory landscape and on the liability landscape, what we see for the capital providers, all of that putting together, this is the number we are putting out year after year. One thing which we have done is that we still have taken capital upfront, so that if there are headwinds, then we can take that headwind head on in coming quarters. For a company with 5 years total experience, of which 1.5 years gone in Covid and credit crisis and remaining 3.5 years of real operating timeline, this level of scale, product diversity, sheer focus on data and analytics and distribution capacity, I have not seen in my 30 years of professional career. Obviously, I understand investors who would expect all companies to perform at the same level. We would also get there very soon.\n",

      "Rahul Bhangadia: Sure sir, UGRO has done an outstanding job of reaching where it has. Now, if you could just give us a perspective of what are the growth rates we are looking for FY 25-26 and if you could just put that in context with what happened in Q4 where the disbursements were, slightly in a slowdown mode.\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (0.994)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Shachindra: First and foremost, we were at Rs 3,000+ in AUM in FY22, at Rs 6,000+ in FY23, and at a Rs 9,000+ in FY24, which means this company sees minimum of Rs 3,000 crore of AUM growth. UGRO has established a very good name within the lending universe, and especially in intermediated market. Some of the lenders who have larger balance sheet capacity are taking assets from us at a much faster pace. The foreclosure for us was a negative surprise, and higher than what we expected. Obviously, we'll correct that, and we will match that at higher growth rate. Quarterly growth coming at 8% rather than 15% was a function of that. What we would do next year is what we are telling you, 3,000 is the minimum pace we will do, there is no doubt about it. We think that we would be 10 to 15% additional of that but when it comes to management focus, that additional growth we want to only do in the segment of the market, which gives us the higher yield which pushes our ROA and that's where we are. Now whether that is 10% higher or 5% higher or 15% higher for us, what matters is that incremental growth is all in the higher yielding segment with a lower credit cost. That's the way we are operating as management team and I think that's the right thing for us to do. Anuj, Amit, anything that you want to add.\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (1.0)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Amit Mande: Absolutely at the end, growth with profitability will be the focus for this year and therefore we are not putting up into whether it is 12, 13, 14. But the fact is that we have to inch our ROA towards the 4% as Shachin has spoken earlier, and that is, that would be the focus of the entire team.\n",

      "Rahul Bhangadia: Okay. If you will allow one final question, I'll come back to the queue. In the bridge from 2.3% to 4% that you very nicely elaborated, I have one question on the credit cost in Q4 itself, you are at about 41 crores of credit cost in the quarter, which, if I generally analyse, you'll be about 2% on the overall AUM. Do you really have the lever?\n",

For the year, we are at around 1.5% and we have been telling that as we season, we will stabilize at around 2%. If you only look at that last quarter, we took a call on a very, very old unsecured loan and took a write off about of about 10 crores, which is over and above what should have been the normal credit cost, but that it was an one-off event. As per our plan and as per the way we have calibrated, we would be between for the next year we should be between 1.8% to 2% overall.\n",

      "Sanidhya Agarwal: Hi! First of all, congratulations on great set of numbers. We as investor are really happy with the kind of AUM growth. My first question is on the credit costs side. We are saying that at 2% we should settle down in terms of credit cost right? How are we seeing at it in let's say a bad cycle, business cycle, or, let's say in any recessionary event if it happens and what are the concerns related to that because we are dealing with global uncertainties? How are we seeing in such a scenario? What could be the impact to business?\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (0.987)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Anuj: There are 2 ways to look at this. The way we have designed our portfolio construct, the portfolio construct will remain same as a principle and that is 70% of the portfolio will remain secured, 30% of the portfolio would be unsecured and within this construct what we have done from last 2 to 3 quarters is that we have started covering our unsecured business through the Central Credit Guarantee Schemes. If you find our percentage of unsecured which was 30% two quarters back, unsecured portion which is not covered by CGTMSE or doesn't have any kind of collateral, has actually come down to 23%. From design perspective, this is how we want to grow to continue to be at 70:30. Now, within that for each of the product we have a lifetime estimate of GNPA and credit cost, and those lifetime GNPAs are the stress scenarios GNPAs. In normal course of things, they would be lower but the way we have designed, we want to cover even the stress scenarios. Of course, for a very large unforeseen event happening like Covid, no one can be really prepared but within the MSME Ecosystem if in a particular state/sector or if in a particular profile, there is a higher stress, our plan takes that into account.\n",

      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Sanidhya Agarwal: Okay, that answers my question. Second, I want to ask you. Are we trying to tie up with any payment platforms like, for example, Paytm or other payment platforms like PhonePe, where the business transactions are taking place on a day-to-day basis, and according to how many transactions the business is growing, even for small businesses that are not GST registered? We are already dealing with GST-registered businesses. Right? Are we also trying to deal with non- GST registered businesses?\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (1.0)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Amit: I want to answer this into 2 parts. One. Of course, we already have a partnership and alliances business where we already have partnerships with whether E-com players or certain payment systems or supply chain systems where we leverage this alternate data to provide credit. The second piece is that this is where, there will be eventual migration of lot of businesses, because it makes credit easier with alternate data available. And so, the acquisition of MyShubhlife is in the same direction which gives us the power of technology and the platform there to be able to embed ourselves in such multiple ecosystems that these products can really scale up on this front as well. Also, one has to be cognizant of the fact that whenever we embed ourselves in these systems, these areproducts which are new ways. We need to test them for a while before we scale up, we need to have a clear eye on what kind of credit cost do they deliver because these, of course, are high yielding products. The approach is to be moving and add these kinds of businesses onto our fold, and that explains the acquisition of MyShubhlife.\n",

      "Sanidhya Agarwal: Thank you. Just to ask last question. We are issuing around 1,300 crores of debentures and share warrants, right? These are all preferentially issued to certain people, so is there anything which you are looking for Retail shareholders as well.\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (1.0)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Shachindra: No. There are multiple ways in which the company can raise capital. You know, one obviously realistic way ‚Äì retail shareholders can always buy from the market, we don't restrict them. But to augment the capital, there are sources available to us. One stated objective of UGRO is to make it completely institutionalized ownership platform. We started with 4 private equity putting in the entire capital, owning almost, 80-90% of our capital structure. One of the PE investor, PAG exited from the market in 2022. That gave opportunity to some large family offices, public market retail investors to buy. That happened at the price range of Rs150 or so when we were trading only 1.1 times P/B. At the same time last year, because the company was not well known in public market, we felt a good source of capital is private, and we went to a very long-only investor sovereign fund and brought the Denmark government IFU into our capital structure. For this capital raise, we felt that if we bring one of 4 existing investor and few of the large family offices of India, it will strengthen our capital structure. For a company which is already listed, to bring broad based retail public, the only option is the right issue and right issue is a time taking cumbersome process, and people expect the right issue to be done at a severe discount with the trading price, which is not in the interest of the existing shareholder and that's why we have chosen this route to bring long term capital in our capital structure.\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (0.686)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Sanidhya Agarwal: Okay, Sir, I just wanted to say on a lighter note that as an investor, we would have been happy to join in for 10,000 odd debentures or warrants if company would have allowed us. We just wanted that kind of clarity from the company in future, that even small investors like us should be able to participate in such.\n",

When we raise capital, we raise through advisors and advisors take us to where we are hungry for food and where the food belongs. It's depending upon the servers who are our advisor. People who advised on this capital raise, we don't know who all they have reached out but where they took, we saw a very great big success rate on that. But they've quite fully taken.\n",

Obviously, you would have missed that otherwise, you could have sent an intimation showing your interest, and we would have included you, but no problem, we'll find a way to make sure that interested people if they want to come, they should be allowed to come, so that capital is not prerogative of only few.

      "Pruthul Shah: Yeah, Sir, congrats for the great capital raise that the company has done. My question is with respect to the AUM guidance that we gave earlier for FY25, which was around 20,000 crore. Now we are not even talking about it. We are talking about 12-13,000 crore AUM, that is one thing and secondly, we have raised capital way more than what we were planning. From both the sides, if you see that we are raising a higher capital and sguiding for a lower AUM, what is the reason that these things are getting changed? Would you clarify on that aspect?\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (0.759)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Shachindra: Yeah and the third thing which we have not guided is what we are guiding to, you see, for any investor like you, there are 4 things which are critical for lending business. First and foremost, the cardinal principle is that they should show some level of predictability and that's why these businesses should have 5 core parameters, they should grow between 30 to 35%. Beyond that you take too much of risk. Below that you are not attractive. Second, they should deliver a good ROA performance, if you're not a bank. Banks can survive on 1.5% to 2% of ROA with the leverage of 7-8x, they get to 18% ROE. NBFCs should deliver at least 3 to 4% of ROA. Fourth, the credit cost should be below 2% to 2.5%, not beyond that. Opex to income ratio should be between 40% to 45%, and depending upon the parentage, leverage can be between 4 to 7x, we said leverage would be upto 4x and co-lending supplements the leverage. If we achieve this for next 5 years, that will reward the investor. In lending universe, you have companies which trade 6x P/B multiple to less than 1x P/B multiple, just look at the NBFC curve. But what correlation would always be found is RoA, RoE and growth rate performance. The question is that you said that by FY25, we said, by exit of 2025, if we were to achieve a certain level of failure but that area was not helping the cause for other 4 parameters, then we have to recalibrate and adjust. We have proven our capability to growth. If you think the growth is the only parameter for value creation, we can grow at 100% for next 7 - 10 years. That's not a problem, because of the credit gap of which, 80% is in the target customer segment of UGRO (Rs 15 L to 15 crore turnover). You can grow as much as you want, but that level of growth requires a different level of capital, different level of free liability, pricing so on and so forth. Market situation, changing liability cost. But what we are saying is, what is that we want to achieve? What we want to achieve is a sustainable level of value creation for our existing shareholder, for every public market shareholder, for the new investor who are coming now, and that, we believe, is a function of growth combined with RoA, RoE performance. We will do that. That is the topmost priority. Second, why, we are taking that much of capital we have taken -we have said that we will take Rs 500 crore of capital but on the headline number, we have taken Rs 1,330 core of capital. Existing large investor are taking massive dilution at a price to multiple of 1.6 - 1.7 times, who should be the ones to be very, very unhappy. What we told them - we said that we can do tranche capital base. We raise Rs 300-400-500 crore capital now and we go next year, probably our price to book multiple would change, and we raise one more round of capital at that point of time. Given that we got so much of acceptability from some prestigious investors in the country. We say, because this is structured, it is a gradual dilution and not an immediate dilution. I'm getting a CCD - which will get diluted when it's get converted. Dilution would happen when warrants would convert. And that's why, if we can lock all the 2 years of capital needs for our growth and exactly same growth rate, what we have planned, we should take it. Today, our capital would go up by 550 crores, when the warrant would convert, the next level of capital would come in. It might lead to give more confidence to rating agency which might lead to rating upgrade. It will give more confidence to all our 30, 40 large lenders that this company has. No problem of capital also reduces the cost of borrowing. It gives more confidence to us as a management team that, come what may, if there is a hostile environment, if there is a little bit of any change in the ecosystem, we have the capital. That's our rationale. We genuinely believe that what we say here and what we deliver - investors are very smart, they understand the real intent of what we are saying. We wanted to tell all of you that we have the capacity to grow while we are a young company. There is no company in India in the lending space, especially NBFC which has delivered 9,000 crore of asset in 36 months flat and I'm saying it with lot of sense of responsibility. Now we are saying that in next 24 to 36 month our next stop is to deliver profitability, which matches to the best of the peers. Because we are in it to build it for life and create an institution. And some of you who participate in that journey would judge us on every quarter basis and we are happy to answer to all of your questions, for that.\n",

      "Avinash Singh: Yeah. One question from the chat. The question by Amit is what went wrong in supply chain lending, 14% yield channel, is seeing 4% plus GNPA. Any learning from this? What correct actions we are taking?\n",

      "Anuj: Overall, for an NBFC like us, the way supply chain finance ecosystem has evolved and the way we see the opportunity we think that for our kind of institution which is focused on a digital data science-based solution, the last leg of supply chain, which is from distributor to retailer fits in the best, the exposure are granular. More and more retailers are getting digitally enabled, technology solutions are available on board and underwrite them seamlessly and the rate of interest or the yields which are desired can be obtained from this segment because there is relatively less penetration. In our experience, the main anchor to supplier side and anchor to dealer side is more of large NBFCs and Banks domain, and we don't want to compete there. It is touch and feel underwriting - we tried and tested for our systems but we found that our moat would lie here in the last leg. Now coming to a relatively larger NPA within our product portfolio, it is a function of the AUM growth which we had. There were a few bad apples and one or 2 anchors with us in this stress kind of a scenario just after Covid and because we didn't want to grow the AUM in that space too much, as a percentage, the GNPA is looking higher. What we have decided now is that we will have an accelerated rundown of that portfolio, and we will progressively build the granular last mile retailer finance portfolio.\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (0.498)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Shachindra: I would just add, to talk about what Anuj said. For the benefit of everyone who is listening, supply chain as the ecosystem component has multiple legs - the first leg is a vendor supplying to an anchor and banks lending to the vendor, believing that the money would come from the anchor. It is nothing but an off-balance sheet exposure to a large AAA rated anchor. Now that the financing happens at the rate of 7% with track, and without track, 6-8%. Now, we can't compete there. Our cost of borrowing is 10.7%. Second leg ‚Äì Anchor selling to a very large distributor, which also have a CC/OD facility from a bank. So on both side of that spectrum we were getting customer, which were lower rated and were willing to pay our price. Theoretically, we are getting negative selection at BBB- or BBB+ company and we realized that that is not where we should be. Some of that reflection is in the NPA. While what I was said that because the portfolio is running down, the NPA would be higher. But that's where we felt that for a AAA anchor, nobody provides the financing for his last mile retailer, because that requires physical infrastructure, digital infrastructure, that data-tech driven underwriting, very small ticket size, that's where we should focus. Our learning is how we should play in the segment. Our strength is to understand data, underwrite basis that. UGRO‚Äôs strength is then take the case to an underwriter who does a templated basis underwriting. Third strength is physical distribution and collection infrastructure which is today 105 branches going to almost 400 branches in next 2 years and we will play all our products to our strength rather than competing to the people who have balance sheet level strength.\n",

      "Omkar: Hi, Congrats on the fund raise as well as the results. My first question is on the Co-lending income it has been very strong during the quarter. Is this a one off? Because it's a Q4 or is this going to.\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (1.0)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Kishore: Co-lending income is gradually increasing. The proportion of co-lending in the overall AUM is increasing. Hence the income is increasing at this quarter. A little bit of blip is there on the higher side because we have done rate reset for our end customers which has resulted into the upfronting, so part of it you can treat as one off.\n",

      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (0.997)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Kishore: There are multiple parts to it. First part is on the broader interest rate cycle. We think that considering the global scenario and considering the domestic scenario, interest rates are unlikely to go down in the first half of the year at least. It may take even third quarter or fourth quarter of the year before interest rates starts going down. Considering our vintage, our performance and our strong relationship with multiple sets of lenders, and also coupled with this equity raise, which is fairly large which is almost equivalent to our current equity, we should get rating upgrade and also it will give additional comfort to our existing lender because equity always gives significant comfort to the lenders, so it should help us in terms of bringing down the cost of borrowings. We had a rating upgrade in March, CRISIL upgraded us from A- to A/Stable. Quick rating upgrade does not come by but we are quite positive that once they get to know about this fundraise we should get another round of rating upgrade shortly.\n",

      "Anil Tulsiram: Thank you for the opportunity. ROA bridge. My problem is you giving lot of increase in the expected ROA. Can you explain what gives you confidence to increase the branches from 75 to 250. And what has been the experiencing recovery from the past defaults? That's the first question.\n",

      "Amit: If you've been following us, we launched these 75 branches in 2022-23. At that point of time when we launched these, we waited to see how these branches perform, what is the learning, and we've seen that all these branches breakeven in anywhere between 12 to 15 months. Given the accelerated learning after that, on our micro enterprises model, we are opening under the next level of 75 branches and we've already opened. These should go live during this quarter, and the next 100 branches will come in during the year. The confidence is coming from the fact that there is a proof of concept. There is accelerated learning curve. There is a product suite that can be distributed out from these branches, which our peer sets may not have, and therefore, the productivity is higher, and from there, with a strong base, there is an ability to scale up and grow.\n",

      "Anil Tulsiram: Okay. and Sir, is my understanding right that the entire loan of micro loans is secured by the Central Agency.\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (1.0)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Amit: Not the micro enterprises. These loans are secured, loans secured by property, either residential or commercial. These are loans up to 25 lakh rupees in tier 2 tier 3 towns. They're secured by property.\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (1.0)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Anil Tulsiram: The next question is on the cost. The entire decrease in cost will be only because of increasing the scale, or we are taking any steps to reduce the customer acquisition cost.\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (1.0)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Shachindra: Both the reasons combined. One, of course, that there is an overall scale impact which is leading to the whole reduction in cost to income ratio. You would have seen our cost to income ratios drop quarter on quarter or year on year over last 2-3 years, and we‚Äôll keep going from the current band towards the towards the range between the 40 to 45% over next 8 quarters. That's number one. Number 2, cost of acquisition, there are multiple channels where we acquire. The intermediate channel is a very, very commercialized channel. We all know a lot of other players also playing the channel so cost in these channels are more or less standard. However, as our productivity increases in our micro enterprises, the equipment finance loans, and our direct channels, our cost of customer acquisition will keep coming down, which will also add to the drop in our cost to income.\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (0.601)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Anil Tulsiram: Then the last question is on the DSA. They are known to take the file to anyone who's giving higher commission, so do we have any plans to increase our own channels, our own men on the street to source the loans, or we will rely more on the DSAs going forward.\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (1.0)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Amit: Our intermediated volumes if you've been following again, have been at 58-59% last quarter. At the end of this year, they will be in the range of 45%. Which means that, given our expansion in micro enterprises branches, given our expansion in the ecosystem business, there is a conscious effort to move away from the dependence on these. That's number one. Number 2 - this also is imperative, because Shachin also touched upon the foreclosure rates, and these foreclosures also are a function of how it was originated, and we felt the pinch of it last year, so there will be a continuous conscious effort to move away from the intermediated channels. We see this going towards 40% or sub 40% in next 8 quarters.\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (0.946)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Shachindra: Absolutely unfair to say that DSA take file where the there's the highest rate. Intermediaries in India play a very important role to get timely credit to MSME. The actual rate of intermediation within DSA industry is uniform. While there is competitive pressure, if suppose a new player enters, it might give 10 basis point higher, but that‚Äôs the easiest. For secured loan between 1.25% to 1.5% is the standardized commission rate, for a business loan, 2.5%-3.5% is a standardized rate. DSAs don‚Äôt work on machinery and rooftops but we are making them learn. What DSAs want is a good price for the customer and a very superior turnaround time. Our turnaround time vis-a-vis big players (all the big names in the industry), we win business on our power of turnaround time. Machine says, yes and no, a platform in 60 min says, gives in-principle approval, and that is why, at a little higher blended portfolio yield of 12.75%-13% vis-a-vis competition at 10.5%, we still win our business. The only trouble or only challenge is, this is a customer because of his primeness is always hunting for a lower rate so once the customer comes to us, because for turnaround time the competition offers at a lower price, that it moves away from us and with the way we think is that we have to engage our DSA partners with multi product, we will gradually become more competitive on the pricing side. And that's why this would remain an important component of our business. But we are focused on building our direct universe. Today 50% come from our intermediate channel. All of our micro enterprises is direct. All of our machinery is direct, all of our retailer financing is direct, all of our partnership and alliance is with another NBFC or Fintech. All of our digital is direct. This proportion would tilt gradually. From a 50%, the intermediate would go down to 40%, go down to 30-35%. The reason why it would go down because they are more products being added to intermediary channel. We are telling the intermediaries. You can also do rooftop solar. Because it is in our interest that our intermediary partner also learns to do more than just selling a LAP or a business loan. Our absolute volume may not go down but our focus is to increase our funnel to direct customer. I want to tell DSAs- you are an important partner to us. Yeah, but we would like to own the customer and service the customer need, and that is why we go in more direct.\n",

      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Shachindra: If we want, we can take it. These loans are priced largely at 30%. They have a short tenor of 30 to 90 days, the customer might come back on daily basis. We have presumed very high credit costs and the pricing being low, we will see whether we need a credit guarantee on top of that or not. The credit guarantee is nothing but insurance. You can take the same insurance on your own by over provisioning for that. The customer segment would be eligible for credit guarantees scheme. In fact, most of these customers would be eligible for Mudra, eligible for CGFMU, and some of them would be eligible for CGTMSE as well and if you read the BJP manifesto, and if they happen to be the next forming government, they have promised that the Mudra limit will be increased from Rs 10L to 20L.\n",

      "Sonal Gandhi: Oh, hi! Congratulations on the equity raise, Sir! I have 2-3 questions. One on the co-lending income you've touched upon it. The question was, we have done some reset right. I heard that up almost 30 basis points on a on a blended basis to a question. Are the rates higher in this quarter because of that reset. And look at, Co-lending plus direct assignment AUM and if I look at the income which is upfront, you know, almost 19% versus about 14%-14.5% in previous 2 quarters. So maybe if you could help me or guide us, how should we build that number in in next 2 years?\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (0.999)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Kishore: It depends upon the product mix as well. Every product comes with a different yield band, and that upfronting will depend upon the quantum of DA or CLM which we do in that product segment be it in the business loan segment or the micro business loan segment. If we have, even if we do lower numbers, then the upfronting would be significantly high, because those products are at 19% to 20%, and bankers would normally take around 9.5% to 10% compared to a secured product where the yields are 14%, the bank would still take about 9%-9.5% and the margins would be significantly low. We have to do significantly higher volume on the same quantum of upfront income. It would depend upon the mix of all the products that how much income would come in. Ofcourse this quarter, as I explained earlier, that we have done rate reset for all our secured products, where we are on floating rates and that has given an additional blip on this upfronted income.\n",

How much of that has gone into the co-lending and then there is a bifurcation of co origination and as well as DA. Co-origination is largely spread income. Co-lending is retention income, which comes all upfront. If you apply that matrix, and we have also been telling you that if we are at run rate exit at 550 crore, incremental AUM growth will come, and higher yielding micro enterprises secure loan, and there is a percentage component of that which is already in the co-lending.

If suppose theoretically, you are doing 550 crore a month, and if we were to do a 600 crore a month, incremental 50 crore would come at 20%, which is also secured loan.

      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Shachindra: What they exactly do, I'll give you a case study. If there is FINO, or if there is Pine lab, or there is Airtel payment bank and if there is a merchant, who uses the QR, needs suppose ‚Çπ50,000 to buy some material, and he needs credit for that. He should be able to repay on a daily basis from the payment which he is receiving from his customer. What is available is that all this payment is get reflected in a FINO payment bank account and the transaction flow is visible. What MSL does is that it integrates it to the payment ecosystem, what it gets through the consent of the customer, the access of the transaction for money coming in, money going out and bases that it's data algorithm, underwrite credit. It is for a short amount of 30 days how much of money can be given to the underlying customer. So that is what MSL does, and it has proven that model works, for, almost 6-7 years. What they didn't have is the balance sheet. When this platform becomes our subsidiary, our platform is already integrated to some of these systems, and we provide the balance sheet and our supervision probably reduces their cost of borrowing. Would also lead to more customer acquisition and the accretion of P&L for us. Transaction structure, I've already explained. It's an acquisition for 45 crores which is valued not like the way VCs value Fintech platform. It is valued at 1.9x P/B value. Target Company already had 23 crores of networth, and we have acquired for 45 crores. 36% of that is being paid in cash to give exit to one of for one of their investor, which only need cash and balance they will take shares of UGRO at the same price on which we are doing the preferential allotment. These are some of the best VCs and early-stage funds in the world, and they will become very small shareholder in UGRO. But they will come on our cap table.\n",

      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Mohd Ansari: My question is about EPS. You have indicated that for the next 2 years the AUM will grow at 30%. I am assuming that the profit will be more so even if the profit goes up by 45%, then at the end of 2 years after equity dilution, we'll still end up with an EPS of ‚Çπ19 only from the present Eps of ‚Çπ13. It won't go up more than that. And how are we going? Market is not going to reward you with an increased price. That way you have a diluted huge equity dilution.\n",

      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Shachindra: First and foremost, you know, while PE and EPS are very critical parameter. Because capital is always taken into the company, lending institution get value (and you should speak to most of that) on growth, ROA, ROE performance, and that define price to book value. And obviously EPS is embedded into that. The one our capital, is coming in a staggered fashion. We have to see at that point of time. as we guided that our profit growth would be definitely, significantly higher compared to our AUM growth. And that would continue to be the trend for next 3 years, and it will be significantly superior. Last year our AUM was 6,000 core, but for profit was 40 crore. Our AUM is 9,000 crore this year, but profit is 120 crore, of course. Next year we it will not be 3x. But the trend will continue. The way to think about is that 1,330 crore of capital when it get converted, should be adding around 5 crore more shares. So from 9 crore to 14 crore, total number of shares might increase. Our capital raise of Rs 1,330 crore added to networth of 1,440 crore, and 2 years of profitability should be the networth. When we apply 18% RoE, our Eps would be far superior than what it is today.\n",

      "Avinash Singh: Question we take from Amit Parik. Please go ahead.\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (1.0)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Amit Parik: Okay, okay? So I would just like to ask. We went for a preferential issue. We could also be gone for cash issue. Why not? We went for preferential issues to some additional investors right. We are unnecessarily favouring new investors. Do we not value existing literature order, sir.\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (0.723)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Shachindra: It is the other way around, sir. If we had issued in cash fully, then the existing shareholders would have been diluted immediately rather than taking the immediate dilution, we are staggering it for 18 months.\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (0.715)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Amit Parik: Existing investors are not there for a single or 2 quarters right. There is a time concept of time value of money, and if we give discount in the name of warrants for 18 months. the 10 to 20%, you said, is what primary investors get.\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (1.0)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Kishore: Yeah, but it comes with the rider also that once they exercise the warrant then they have to be locked in for 6 months. Considering the current scenario and considering the external environment, we thought that this would be the best structure. Because this is the large quantum we could gather by view of this structure, which normally otherwise, could not have come. In a direct cash link and equity raise, probably it would have been too dilutive immediately for the immediate shareholders who are there. If all the conversion happens after 18 months, then for 18 months, the existing shareholders does not have any dilution. Also, we believe UGRO has a massive potential to get re-rated. We are highly undervalued relative to our peers, and we wanted to make sure the incoming shareholders stay with us for a while, and it should not start happening that the price goes up big time and all these investors exit. That's also why we wanted to make sure that we do a staggered raise with a lock-in.\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (0.574)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Amit Parik: If you have a very high potential, why would the incoming investors sell off the shares and go away, sir?\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (0.957)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Shachindra: When people look at a different perspective and incentive to book the profit. Right? That's at a philosophical level. And that's why I said that we think this was a good structure to log capital, attract high quality investors, and get capital in a staggered manner through this method.\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (0.978)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Amit Parik: You said you have attracted high quality of investors, but we have added new hundreds of investors for such a small amount, sir. How are they not convinced by putting in heavier amounts in your company, sir. Because no large good institution ‚Ä¶\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (1.0)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Shachindra: Okay, we'll answer this last time, and I'll explain you the context and probably move on to the next question. First and foremost. This company has attracted some of the world's best equity investor in form of private equity and some of the world's best DFIs. It's entirely institution based capital. Nobody should ever question about our ability to raise capital from institutional investor. One of our existing investor, which is a blue chip private equity investor, put 500 crores of commitment in this capital raise, and some of the best family offices put very substantial amount of money. We don't want to create concentrated shareholding. Concentrated shareholding means that at some point of time the concentrated shareholder would like to exit, and that puts big pressure on the stock. That's why we want to diversify and democratize our own shareholding. That's our strategy, and that we think is best for our company.\n",

      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (1.0)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Piyush Bothra: Yeah. My question is on the quality of the on book. We see that the on book npa is around 3.5% and on the total book NPA is 2%. I believe the underwriting parameters should be same for both on book and off. Is there any specific reason why the on book NPAs are higher than the off book.\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (0.901)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Anuj: It is the way it is designed. What happens is when you log off book. A substantial part of that is co origination. and in co-origination we tie up with other NBFCs, and we give FLDG. On that co-origination book when FLDG is utilized, only those cases come back in our book. and that is why, as a percentage, it looks higher. Going forward also, the strategy is to be at around 50% off book. And out of that 50% a substantial amount with would be in co-origination. So, this differential will keep happening.\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (0.936)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Piyush Bothra: So you mean to say, if the loan goes bad on the co-origination one, then it will come back to UGRO.\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (0.826)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Anuj: Because FLDG is utilized.\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (1.0)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Piyush Bothra: Is the FLDG only for the NBFCs? For banks, you cannot do anything.\n",

      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (1.0)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Anuj: Yeah, about 5%. And it is utilized at actuals. Whatever the NPA rate is for that given product..\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (1.0)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Piyush Bothra: Okay, so going forward when you're increasing that 3,000 crore of AUM this year. This secured - is there any anything related to the secured and the unsecured book, like you're doing more unsecured on the on book side, or more secured more.\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (0.996)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Shachindra: No, nothing, no, nothing like that. If you see the on book versus off book percentages across our products, they've remained steady for last 4-5 quarters. Yes, lot of unsecured portfolio, historically, has gone into co-origination and because unsecured, has traditionally higher NPA rates. That is why the reflection on on-book of that is relatively higher. But we plan to move steadily to banks, even for co-origination and once we transition that (and that require a lot of technology integration on banks‚Äô part etc). But once we do that, then this differential will start coming down.\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (0.861)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Piyush Bothra: What's the comfort zone for a on book GNPA for you? So right now it's ~3%. What's the comfort level for you like it?\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (1.0)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Anuj: It is a number which is a derived number in our case, and that's why our planning is at AUM basis. We are quite comfortable, and lot of our banks‚Äô covenants are basis that comfort, and we are quite comfortable to go up to 5%.\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (0.724)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Piyush Bothra: Oh, yeah. Awesome.\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (0.924)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Anuj: I would say, I will start explaining this way, that while we maintain everything is at AUM level, our financial institutions also look at on book GNPA, because floor rate they calculate on basis of on-book. Now, you know, it's little complicated. We have a co-origination wherein we have given the FLDG. So that portfolio technically is on book. While it is de-linked and we are not applying capital but we are applying FLDG. We have a co-lending book his is on non-re-course to us, and we have an on-balance sheet. We are trying to alter the model in a way wherein the on book plus off-book should come to the parity. We always think that the on-book would run in this way, because certain high yielding product which banks don't understand would remain on our balance sheet and rest will continue to go on off- balance sheet, and there is a recourse, and non-recourse basis, but broadly you should take - what you are seeing at AUM level will be in this rate, and at a balance level would be in this range.\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (0.998)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Piyush Bothra: Apologies for my ignorance. Did you say that co-origination is on book?\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (1.0)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Shachindra: It is not all booked, it is off book. Which means there's no capital required for that. But given there is an FLDG, we provide for that. because if I have a 15 or 22,000 crore of off book in form of Co regulation, and I provided 5% Fldg, then I have to provide for potential credit cost on book today. To that extent we take the risk of that portfolio on our balance sheet.\n",

      "Piyush Bothra: So just one quick update. If you can share on the GRO app, you had a pilot app on it one year back, and a lot of advertisements we saw on TV as well. What's happening on the GRO app? If you can just share.\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (1.0)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Shachindra: It is working very fine. We have been continuously adding customers except one problem. We launched our app with a core idea that it is a credit on UPI platform. Simultaneously. RBI guidance on credit on UPI came in. Which by design or you know by default, they said credit on UPI would only be available to banks, and not to the NBFCs. What it meant that our core proposition that the customer takes loan on app, receives the disbursement through a QR Code, and pays back through a QR Code got stopped. Now we pivoted that and it became an app where credit is available at a click is available, and is designed to disperse through, NACH and recover through NACH. Every customer of UGRO, we are offering GRO X as an attachment, so that the app continues to function. Some of its functionality is now being would be used in retailer financing. One very large lender in India (which is a bank equivalent) is also trying to white label, and they are allowed to do that. I think, on a long term basis, RBI will be able to finally open up credit on UPI for NBFCs as well. But it's like any NBFC credit card kind of a thing, and we have to be ready for that. In the interim period, we are monetizing our investment and our brand cost by these steps.\n",

It has been built with lot of passion & rigor. In this this round of capital, not just me you would have seen that the entire management team of UGRO has also invested. There's saved capital into the company along with the investors. We genuinely believe that India's MSME deserves to change, they need to be provided credit. They need to be given opportunity to grow as because they provide employment to millions and millions of deserving people of this country given that India's ecosystem is growing. Given, that the MSME contribution to GDP is growing. Given, that our tier 2-tier 3 towns are maturing. Some of us who come from those small cities and town have this aspiration to make UGRO as India's predominantly small business financing institution. This result is in line with that passing quarter. We will continue to give you the good result, and hopefully, with all your blessings. UGRO in few years would be India's largest, most revered financial institution for SMBs. Thank you very much.\n",

I would like to thank UGRO management for giving us this opportunity to host the call. I would now like to hand over the call to Mr. Shachindra Nath, Vice Chairman and MD, for his opening comments.

      "Shachindra Nath: I am the Managing Director of UGRO. I welcome you all in our December Quarter's Earnings Call. Along with me, the senior management team, consisting of Mr. Kishore Lodha, our CFO; Mr. Anuj Pandey, our Chief Risk Officer; Mr. Amit Mande, our Chief Revenue Officer; and Om Sharma, our Chief Operating Officer, are also present in the call. Our investor presentation is already uploaded, and I will be referring to the same presentation in our conversation with you. Kindly refer to the Slide 3 of the presentation. Over the past few quarters, we have been consistently speaking about the large addressable market opportunity for MSME and how the credit gap for them has widened post-COVID. This slide demonstrates the strong rebound by MSME, post the initial dip during COVID. If you look at the left-hand side of the chart, based on the data we have gathered from applications, we see that loan sanctioned per customer average INR 40 lakh in 2019. This number halved during the first and second wave of pandemic. However, in Q3FY21, there has been a strong resumption in business activity. In the first year, post-pandemic, that is in FY22, 77% MSME in UGRO's target segment experienced a business resumption. Next year, 68% of MSME saw more than 10% year-on-year growth in the turnover. This has led to increasing credit sanctions per customer post-COVID, as seen in the right-hand side of the chart. Over the last 3 quarters, the loan amount sanctioned per customer has averaged around INR90 lakhs, much higher as compared to the pre-COVID period. Both these charts demonstrate the resilience of the MSME sector, increasing credit flow to this sector and the importance of timely credit for small businesses. Besides this macro trend, it gives us the confidence that building a large institution around MSME financing, this power of Datatech is a real possibility. Now, moving to the performance of the business. Please refer to Slide 4. Our early opex and infrastructure build continues to deliver strong top line and bottom line growth. In 9MFY24 we have delivered 64% year-on-year AUM growth, while our PAT has tripled on a strong operating leverage. Our return ratios have improved to 2.3% return on assets and 9.7% return to equity from 1% and 3.5% last year, respectively. And over Slide 5 in the presentation, this is a snapshot of other key business metrics. If you refer to the Slide 6, our net disbursement stood at INR1,552 crores during Q3FY24, which represents 33% year-on-year growth, led by a strong growth across our prime business loans, micro enterprises secured loans, machinery secured loans and partnership and alliances segment. This has led to a 64% year-on-year growth in AUM, which has touched INR8,364 crores, explained on Slide 7. We have now reached the coveted INR1 billion AUM. This journey from INR2,500 crores AUM to INR8,300 crores in AUM over the last 8 quarters has been an outcome of our early investment in multiproduct distribution channel, deep partnership with banks and large NBFC on co-lending and co-origination, investment in GRO score and continuous support of our balance sheet liability providers. On Slide 8, you'll notice that this solid top line growth has led to significant operating leverage with PAT growing 8x over the same period. On Slide 9, you will see that our collection efficiency continue to be stable, while GNPA and NNPA stood at 2% and 1.1% of total AUM, respectively. Our GNPA has increased by 0.1% quarter-on-quarter and 0.3% year-on-year basis, which is as per the plan. The increase is a function of our portfolio, which has been maturing over a period of time, and we do not see it as a credit deterioration as our collection efficiency and data have remained stable and tracks well. We intend to cover ourselves well. With respect to provision coverage ratio, it has remained stable at 49%. As we have mentioned in the past, our liability strategy is a function of our on- balance sheet lending from diversified set of lenders, co-lending partnership with banks and NBFCs, and direct assignments with financial institutions. On next slide, you will see that our off book share is 45% of AUM. This is as per our long-term vision of reaching 50% mix. We are seeing our relationship maturing with our bank partners and new partners are coming on board. We believe that next few quarters our contribution of co- lending would gradually start inching up beyond 50% as well. On Slide 13, you will see our cost of borrowing increased 4 basis points quarter-on-quarter. Our borrowing stands at INR4,173 crores with 43% and 10% of this mix coming from banks and NBFC, respectively. DFIs, FIs and capital markets contribute to 18%, 10% and 19%, respectively. So our borrowings are fairly diversified across various financial institutions. We continue to believe that the increased risk weight on bank lending to NBFC would not affect us adversely, given our diversified liability strategy and less reliance on banks. On Slide 14 to 16, details of our financial numbers and key ratios and the remaining slides give an overview of the company. We will continue to believe that UGRO, in coming quarters, would increase its penetration, yield profile and operating leverage. We would be happy to answer any questions now. Thank you.\n",

      "Moderator: The first question is from the line of Darshil Pandya. Please go ahead.\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (1.0)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Darshil Pandya: Congratulations on the good set of numbers. A couple of questions from my end. Sir, are we on track to achieve our aspirational INR10,000 crores AUM by this fiscal?\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (0.943)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Shachindra Nath: Mr. Pandya, that's why we have used the term aspirational. We are striving very hard to get there. But at the current run rate, we are focused on 2 things. Obviously, AUM is one aspect of the business, but we are simultaneously controlling our Opex so that we can deliver operating leverage. If given a choice between increasing AUM and maintaining profitability, we would actually do the latter and will maintain profitability. I think we will be somewhere near to that number, but we don't think that we'll get there completely at INR10,000 crores.\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (0.752)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Darshil Pandya: Got it. And sir, on the Slide 9, where the GNPA by product is given. So there I see that the prime unsecured loans contribute around 3.6% of the GNPA. So any measures that you have taken to take it down, maybe because that's showing one of the...\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (1.0)\n",

      "Shachindra Nath: Yes, Anuj?\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (1.0)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Anuj Pandey: The planned GNPA number for unsecured loan as we have been commenting on various investor call, is between 4.5% to 5% lifetime. Around 89%, 90% of the portfolio is post-COVID, and is now seasoned up to about 24 months. So from traction perspective, we are at where we want it to be. We expect a lifetime NPA of around 4.5% for unsecured loans.\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (1.0)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Shachindra Nath: Annualized credit cost is around 1.5% to 2%. We construct the portfolio to arrive at 2% credit cost. We want to make sure that not just the GNPA, but the total credit cost is within our tolerable range. That's why you see a a certain percentage of portfolio, which have certain defined credit cost metrics. As Anuj said, this is as per the plan. At 19.25% yield, 1.5% to 2% of total credit cost on an annualized basis, we think so this is a good product for us. But obviously, that's why we maintained this at near about 30% of our total portfolio.\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (0.571)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Darshil Pandya: Got it. One final question. Have you opened any new branches this quarter? You said that you'll be opening around 75 more branches. So what's the update on that?\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (1.0)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Shachindra Nath: We started this around 1.5 months back. Look, physical infrastructure rollout is a long journey of around 6 months. It has to be broken in identification (of geographies), which we have identified, so we are expanding in UP, MP and Andhra and few branches in 4-5 states. Post identification of physical infrastructure, then it‚Äôs hiring of people and then the branches go live. At the first 2 stages, we will be ready with 30 locations by end of this month. Operationally, we would be around 25 to 30 locations live and starting business by end of the quarter. Over a period of next 2 quarters, we expect all of these branches to go live. And as you know, the micro branches take around 12 to 15 months to get to the stage of breakeven. But I should tell you this, that relative Opex increase on account of increase in the physical infrastructure has very limited impact on our overall profitability.\n",

      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (1.0)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Shachindra Nath: As far as cost of borrowing is concerned, we have been able to manage the cost of borrowing at fairly reasonable level for the last 4 quarters when things were tough. RBI has increased the rate multiple times. Liquidity is not very encouraging at this point of time. Still, because of the diversity and because of our relationship with all the lenders through the 5 years of our journey, we've been fairly consistent as far as borrowing cost is concerned. It may inch up a little from here on, but we are not expecting a significant jump as far as borrowing cost is concerned.\n",

      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Avinash Singh: Good set of numbers. A couple of questions. First one, if you can elaborate on yours plans for the micro enterprise loans in addition to your branch expansion plan. What sort of aspirations we have over the next year and beyond that to grow that micro enterprise book because that will be largely kept on book and of course, what will be the yields? What sort of AUM target you have, particularly in that segment in the micro enterprise driven by the branch expansion part. So that will be my first question. And second, some color, if you can sort of provide around some bit of an increase in the credit cost and slight moderation. I mean, not Q-o-Q, but Y-o-Y basis in terms of the regular collection efficiency.

You rightly said that the micro enterprise is a slow burn, but highly accretive business to the balance sheet. We have been in that business for almost 2.5 years and it‚Äôs a very hard group. We have learnt how to penetrate into the most profitable, but most underpenetrated business of micro enterprise segment. We now have 75 mature branches delivering roughly around INR75 crores a month. And once we touch that milestone, we have committed to ourselves that when the first round of our 75 branches will get to INR75 crores, we will do the second set of 75 branches, and that's why we started the 2nd round. And these branches, we expect that over a period of 12 to 14 months would also deliver INR75 crores per month basis. Incrementally, as we gain the traction, we would also continue to open more branches, but we will have to manage it basis the operating leverage, that we are promising to investors at last, and the incremental opex we can take. But I think we have to constantly invest in the business for long term, while delivering the quarter-on-quarter profitability as per the expectation. I hope this answers the question you in some way. You want to add something, Amit?\n",

      "Anuj Pandey: From the movement on year-on-year basis, we have seen a additional 12 months review in our unsecured loan portfolio. So the contribution of the unsecured loans GNPA to overall GNP has gone up, as is our provisioning on that. That is what is accounting for a little bit of increase in the GNPA as well as on the credit cost. But this was well envisaged. We have been tracking the bounce rate and collection efficiencies very minutely, and they continue to remain stable and in a comfortable zone. Overall, the portfolio of construct, if you recall, was 30% unsecured and 70% secured. And the weighted average, the way we have designed it, is to have a combined gross NPAs - at a steady-state level of about 2% and a credit cost aspiration of less than 2% on a steady-state level. Today, we are at 1.5%, because it will slightly go up in the next 2-3 quarters and then it will become stable just below 2%. I hope that answers.\n",

      "Omkar: Congrats on the set of results. Just on the net interest income, what we can see is the net interest income line item, which you sold, that has been flat over the past 3 quarters. But of course, that was offset by the co-lending income, which came higher. I just wanted to know how we should look at this and try to model this number?\n",

But despite interest costs going up or cost of borrowing going up, we are able to maintain our mix, which is encouraging. We explained earlier that with micro vertical taking up some yield and with higher yield product mix increasing e in next 12 months, it can expand further. But when the interest rate cycle is on the high, our cost of borrowings is increasing. When we are able to maintain our earnings, we think that it is satisfactory at this moment. As we increase the mix of higher lending products, it will expand further. It is possible that by next year, we may see a reversal in this interest rate cycle. By year-end, probably the topping of interest rates may start seeping in. That point of time, will be the additional ticker for the needs of the company.\n",

      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Shachindra Nath: I would add, the industry at large actually modelled everything on the basis of NII, but for players like us, you have to model us on the basis of total income. If you presume that of our total AUM, half of that is on our balance sheet and will continue to be in that range or will go up, the total income would continue to increase, NII may remain flat. But I mean it is the total spread, which the earnings is not just the spread of interest but the spread of fees or just spread, which we earn on the co-lending as well.\n",

      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Shachindra Nath: No, sir. There are 2 parts to it. One, when the RBI increased the risk weight on banks lending to NBFC, which means their capital allocation becomes higher, which means that translates to the higher cost. That is only one part of it. Second, also, because the year-on-year growth by banks lending to NBFC is more than 21%, there is a moderation in terms of the total lending -- to NBFC by the bank. But having said that in the co-lending when bank books the MSME which is a priority sector asset, the risk weight of that is either low or lower or at least lower than the NBFC lending. It's my hypothesis that the moderation in their portfolio, which is a bank lending to NBFC would have a consequential indirect positive benefit to co-lending because banks should now try to paytake more asset on their balance sheet to the same NBFCs. I don't think there is a correlation that where lending by bank to NBFC sees the cost increase would mean that the cost of co-lending would increase, I think so either it would remain stable or it would come down.\n",

      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Arvind Dalal: My question is more in terms of the mix of liabilities from banks. Is it fixed rate or MCLR linked, and if that is the case then how have you managed to maintain the overall cost of debt despite MCLRs going up for most banks. And on the asset side, how does it translate to I mean, is it fixed rate pricing? Or is it again variable rate linked to some benchmarks. Just to understand the translation mechanism with some bank lending to the assets. That's question one. The second question is, we understand that the trade cost will go up by 50 basis points in the medium term. And the sense I'm getting is that, part of it will be offset by higher yield on the portfolio. So which sections do you plan to kind of recalibrate in terms of your asset side to see that yield mix, which will offset the higher grade cost?\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (0.555)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Amit Mande: Yes, as far as our lending is concerned, barring the unsecured portion lending, which is roughly around 30% rate, most of the loans are floating rate loans. So, we can pass on the incremental cost of borrowing to the customers. As far as our ability to contain the rate where for most of the large players, cost of borrowing has gone up significantly, we could hold our rate. It is a factor of the consistent hard work that we are putting in the last 3-4 years, where we have very deep relationships with a multiple set of lenders. Whatever we have committed on portfolio side that as a company, we have delivered that. That has created a lot of goodwill among the lenders. So, now they are more comfortable lending to us at softer rates, seeing that going through the cycle. This is our primary reason why our cost of borrowing has not gone up as much as for some of the large lenders, which are directly linked to the MCLR for the bank. On your question, how much percentage of our borrowing is linked to MCLR and how we are affected, roughly 43% of our borrowings are from banks which is MCLR linked. Wherever there is an increase in MCLR, of course, that increase would come to us. Over the last 4 quarters, we have not seen RBI increasing the benchmark rate. Recently, some of the banks have increased their MCLR by 10 basis points. Otherwise, last 3 to 4 quarters, benchmark rates have remained more or less stable. On credit cost, Anuj would take it.\n",

What we have mentioned is that the overall credit cost traction in the next few quarters, and, in a steady state basis, is likely to be around 2% or below, and this is as per the design which we had in the starting. We have been adding the higher-yield segment. Shachin mentioned that we have planned to add 75 new branches in micro. Out of that, 30 became active in this quarter and the remaining in next quarter. We've also been adding a lot of infrastructure and resources to expand our retail financing base, which is granular supply chain business for small retailers and have been gradually transitioning out of the lower yield supply chain portfolio.

Our core hypothesis is that we will granulize and we will use data, use technology, and we'll go to the deeper market segment of customer, which is within INR15 lakh to INR15 crores band, we'll design the yield and the portfolio segment wherein the total credit cost can remain in 2%, and we can deliver our 4% return on asset in 15%, 16% or more of return on equity, and we are on that path.\n",

      "Sonal Gandhi: Congrats on good set of numbers. I just wanted some clarification on how do you calculate IRR for the portfolio. So there were certain questions on the NIM. So just to give you some numbers, I mean, your AUM is up 10% Q-o-Q. But if I look at interest income, that is up only 6% on a Q- o-Q basis. Even your on-book AUM is roughly up around 10% Q-o-Q. And the yield for the IRR that we've given on portfolio, that is up by 10 basis points. So where is the difference? Or how do we calculate this portfolio yield?\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (0.785)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Anuj Pandey: So when we mentioned portfolio yield, we think what is the customer IRR on the various segments of our borrowers. So 16.2, 16.3, which is the IRR we disclosed, it is that customers' ROI is for us. On an overall basis. But when you look at on balance sheet, it is again dependent on that how much of that various segment is secured, unsecured, micro remains on our balance sheet, and how much goes into off balance sheet. It does not necessarily mean that whatever remains in the balance would have seen a similar impact as that of overall customer IRR. It will depend upon the mix of portfolio that remains on the balance sheet, which can be lower or higher compared to our overall IRR. To give an example, if we consider a product that is of a lower rating product that remains higher on balance sheet, then our balance sheet interest income would be lower. Our customer IRR would remain steady. Vis-a-vis a micro product, which is a higher yielding product remaining on balance sheet, then our balance sheet interest income would go up, but it may necessarily mean that our co-lending income may be lower. So it is a mix of that.\n",

If you combine the 3, you will be able to understand that how much of total origination, how much has gone into our balance sheet and how much has remained on to the balance sheet.

      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Shachindra Nath: Yes. For micro enterprises business, it is INR 6 crores lower than the last quarter, that is predominantly because we were operating 2 products in micro enterprises. One was micro enterprises secured, which is the predominant large portfolio, and also, we were adding micro enterprises without collateral loans. What we have realized over a period of time that giving micro enterprises, non-collateralized loans was cannibalizing our secured loan and we have moderated that. If a customer comes, who has an ability to offer you a collateral, if you open up a non- collateralized, tendency was not to offer collateral. And that's why have in a way, curtailed it down. That's why there was a moderation of INR 6 crores. And as you say, next quarter, you'll see a jump from there.\n",

      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Sonal Gandhi: Understood. And sir, just one more question. So the co-origination has been going down as a percentage of our off-book AUM. Basically, the share of co-lending is going up. You said it at the beginning of the call that co-lending is something that you will be focusing on. But why is co-origination dropping? That is one. And second is the fair value gains that we are recognizing on direct assignments around co- lending, that has increased substantially this quarter. How should we look at that number from the modelling perspective?\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (0.739)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Shachindra Nath: Yes. As you know, the co-origination has gone down for 2 factors. One, at least 95% to 98% of our co-origination was happening with the larger NBFCs, where we were also providing some kind of first loss cover. But with the credit guarantee scheme coming for the co-lending, and now the interest rate cap on that has been increased from 18% to 21%, the adoption of business loan within the banking segment has accelerated at a very faster pace. Some of our NBFC-led co-origination has moved towards bank. And that's why you have seen a drop from co-origination and it has moved to the co-lending. Most of the origination, which has moved to the co-lending this quarter has happened in option 2, which means that there is a fair value gain, which came into the balance sheet. But I think we are making consistent efforts to moderate it and take it to the option one and increase the volume so that it remains same balance. As we were doing with NBFC, we will try to do it with the bank itself. I think it would take another 2 quarters to get to a stable position. We are getting more new number of partners, banks find it very difficult to do under option one where the turnaround time when we lend at that same time is the same as the bank's. So banks predominantly get attracted to say, you do it on your balance sheet and then we'll take it later. While we keep saying that, in order to generate capacity, you do simultaneously. All of that is going on right now. But in summary, the good thing is the banking system is now adopting all products which you grow. That is a very healthy thing. Right from our prime secured business to prime business loan segment to machinery to our micro enterprises loan, if you look at the chart on the co-origination and co-lending, you'll see, except supply chain, which is very difficult to do co-lending, most of our products are in co-lending segment, which means that our engine and its credibility, its origination, its credit quality within the broader banking system is now getting accepted.\n",

      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (0.999)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Anuj Pandey: On a mature basis from credit cost perspective, although in the investor slides, we have given a GNPA number. I'll start with the GNPA, first and then we will correlate it with the credit cost. For prime secured loans, steady state GNPA would be in the range of 0.5% to 0.75%. For prime unsecured loans, we expect it to be around 4.5% lifetime at a steady-state basis. I will also tell the annualized credit cost impact for each of those, for prime unsecured loan, actually the credit cost percentage annualized was less than 2%. For unsecured loans, it is less than 2%. For micro enterprises, at steady-state GNPA would be around between 2.5% to 3%, where the corresponding credit cost would be in the range of 0.75% to 1%. On supply chain, it is a little higher than expected at this point in time. But when we are transitioning towards retailer finance and a steady-state GNPA should be about 2% to 2.5%. On machinery loan, the expected GNPA on a steady-state basis is between 0.75% to 1%, and the corresponding credit cost in the range of 0.2% to 0.3%. And in partnership and alliances, because we have a credit enhancement in place, we don't expect any credit cost going forward, though it can happen in rarest of rare case.\n",

      "Amit Mande: Yes. The only thing I would say, Sonal, that for analysts like you to model over, this is a little difficult because the translation of this credit cost to our balance sheet is depending upon how much of that portfolio is held on to the balance sheet and held in co-lending and held in co- origination. Wherever you model the credit cost guidance we are giving you should look at on balance sheet plus co-origination coming to the balance sheet and no credit cost coming when it comes to the co-lending. I think that you have to be careful. It's not a straight-through model that you do for banks and NBFCs.\n",

One update that the company has made recently with respect to entering into the factoring business, it would be good if you give some gains of this business, how the government platform would be used and how it would be beneficial to UGRO? And probably what would be the yields in credit cost that we are internally expecting by entering in this business?\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (0.954)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Shachindra Nath: Thank you. This is a factoring license. It is not expansion of new line of activity for us. While around 4 years back, mainline NBFCs were allowed to additionally have factoring license, and it's taken roughly around 1.5 years for us to get, and we are now a factor. What it does for us, one, obviously, we are eligible to now participate on the TReDS platform. But I don't think that the NBFC like us are competitive to play on the test platform because the yield at which the invoices get discount there is predominantly for banks and very large NBFCs. But what it does is facilitate and improvise certain product of ours. So to give you a practical example, in our regular financing and in our supply chain ecosystem, we do sales invoice discounting. Sales invoice discounting means that if I'm selling honey to Dabur, I've been doing it for 5 years, and UGRO want to discount the invoice, which as a vendor for Dabur, I have sold the material, and I want to get in money against that. In today's scenario, Dabur pays back that money to me, when I'm a supplier, and then I pay back to UGRO because there is a financing is there. The risk is that if I have some other need at that point of time, I would spend money that Dabur pays to me, I will use that money for something else. Now we convert that as a factor, which means I assign that receivable to be on the factoring act and Dabur is obligated to pay that money directly to me. So I have a recourse against the vendor as well as Dabur. So some of our products actually would now be more palatable and we should be able to grow that, how much is what, we are making an assessment. But I think tally gives us a regulatory cover, there is the very large need of getting working capital against invoices, we should be able to enable through this license.\n",

So our portfolio construction is a long-term strategy. 70% of our portfolio would like to be secured by some form of collateral, 30% of our portfolio we would like to do without collateral. Of that bucket of 70%, there is a certain percentage of portfolio, which we'll do against receivable and other form of business. I don't think so that this changes the construction of our portfolio.

And in that case, it might happen that the customer is sent a separate link through which you can pay. But that also, about 90% of that collection, is also electronic. In far and few cases, the customer can opt sometimes opt for a cash collection. We don't encourage it, but sometimes it is part of the game, and hence, we take it.

How our underwriting process is different or what we have learned from them to ensure that we don't face the same problem? That is the question, mainly on the underwriting process, selection of the customers, geographies, collateral, all those things.\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (0.945)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Shachindra Nath: Sir, predominantly, housing finance company, whether the prime housing finance company, like the HDFCs and other or affordable housing finance company are evaluators of collateral. So they rely on collateral first and repayment ability second. We rely on repayment ability first, collateral is the second defence to recover our money in case of a default. I think the 2 businesses are not comparable, not parallel. We lend to businesses. We assess their cash flow. We look at their repayment ability and whether that is done by a machine, or in case of micro enterprises, through a rigorous process of a templated underwriting. Once our system on people are comfortable that the customer during the defined period has the visible cash flow to pay back the interest plus principal, then only we lend. But for the minute or percentage of people who will go in default, we take collateral to recover our money. So I think that's -- Amit, do you want to add something to it?\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (0.998)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Amit Mande: I think that's enough. The point is that a lot of analysis and investment needs to done to understand the customers' business behavior, unlike a typical housing loan. That is why the numbers will be very different in the future.\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (1.0)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Anil Tulsiram: Yes. And I have a request also maybe this quarter or next quarter whenever you find feasible. Can you add some slides on the micro loan book so that we can understand more how the customers are selected, geographies are selected, the organization structure, number of staff. There are lots of questions which may not be possible to ask in the call, but if you can provide some slides, that will be very helpful.\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (1.0)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Shachindra Nath: We will try to do that. But the difficulty of the challenge is that most of our peer set are in only one segment or 2 segments. Somebody does only high ticket, somebody only does MFI, when it comes to the MSME financing, we have taken this enormous task to ourself to solve the problem of credit, and that we are doing through multiple modes, right? Micro in itself is a business which has multiple metrics, so is our supply chain, so is machinery. We have been getting this constant feedback that our investor presentation is very large and elaborate, and you should focus on more key return metrics and deliver that -- that's what market monitor us. When anyone has a more detailed question trying to understand the segment, we are happy to do that. But we take your point and we'll see that how, in some of our slides, we give more data around each of our segment, not just micro.\n",

      "Anil Tulsiram: Okay. And sir, the last question is, I think 6 months or 1 year back, RBI allowed NBFC to do eKYC through some KUA or something. So have you already registered for this license or we are planning to register this?\n",

      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (1.0)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Nitin Gupta: Mr. Nath, I have a couple of questions. There was some problem on the line, so I'm not sure if you have answered them already. The first one is, are you on track on your guidance of 3% ROA by FY24 end, and 4% by FY25 end, financial year. And same thing goes for ROE.\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (1.0)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Anuj Pandey: Fully on track as far as guidance on ROAs are concerned. We are fairly confident that whatever we have guided on ROAs and ROEs, we should be almost there, some basis point here and there. Next year, we are again on the drawing board for meeting our next year 30 to 45 days, we will be clearer in our mind that where we will be. But the path is directionally, we are moving towards to that.\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (0.993)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Shachindra Nath: As I have keep saying that, look, we believe that we are in the journey of making an institution. Our capital structure is institutional. Our governance is structure is independent. And this is led by an entrepreneurial management team, which want to deliver an MSME financial institution in India. On that part, we believe that the best financial services and lending companies deliver 5 -- 3, 4 things. Steady-state growth rate of 30% and above, and ROA between 3.5% to 4% and ROE of 18% and above, credit cost below 2%. Only difference is that most of the lending companies deliver this ROA on leverage of 6 to 7, whereas we will deliver this ROA leverage of 3.5 to 4 because we have this model of balance sheet business. I think we are continuing on that path. We think that our investors current, prospective and public markets, would continue to benefit from this conviction of ours that we can deliver an institution. Some degree of variation in some quarters, in some years, do not deter us from our long-term goal of delivering an institution to you.\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (0.994)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Nitin Gupta: Okay. The second question which I wanted to ask is with respect to the AUM. So I have learnt -- I mean, in the previous calls that I have attended, I've learnt that you were saying it to be roughly INR9,500 crores to INR10,000 crores by FY24 end and around INR18,000 crores to INR20,000 crores by FY25 end. So even the lower end seems far fetched right now, because one point which I want to really emphasize here is we achieved an AUM of around INR1,000 crores in the Q4 of financial year FY23, but we haven't been able to achieve any of the quarters in this financial year.\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (0.994)\n",

      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (1.0)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Nitin Gupta: I'm saying what about the guidance with respect to the AUM. Because as per what I'm observing from the past few quarters, the guidance which have been given, I don't think even the lower end, they will be able to achieve it. And to give an example, like we have not been able to achieve a quarterly AUM growth of INR1,000 crores which was delivered in the Q4 of financial year 22.\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (0.539)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Shachindra Nath: This is a fair question. I think this I've been saying for long. As institutional builder, we put ourselves and we don't differentiate on what we say in the market and we say to our Board and we say to ourselves, we would like to be the largest financial institution around MSME financing and we put milestones behind that. We have put a milestone of INR10,000 crores, then INR20,000 crores, then INR30,000 crores, then INR50,000-odd crores and also simultaneously to reward the shareholders and for shareholders to benefit from that, we have to deliver the end bottom line profitability. If you're a public market investor and if you have to gain from investing in our stock, then it is just not the function of the top line growth or AUM, but it is also comparable delivery of the bottom line performance. We make that adjustment between premium growth to bottom line performance, and that's why the play is there is always a little bit of a degree of variation come. What we have said, we exited March '23 at a INR550 crores gross run rate. We said that we will now will not invest in further Opex. We would deliver INR550 crores on a monthly basis. And this is that math and what would be the end of the year, we aspire to be at INR10,000 crores. But simultaneously, we also make promises to deliver certain bottom line performance. Depending upon the liquidity, depending upon the flow, depending upon the credit cost, depending upon the arbitrage between AUM to the profitability, the business automatically get recalibrated and hopeful all of you would be rewarded. If you look at in our peer lending segment, there is no company, and I repeat, there is no company which has able to triple its AUM in a difficult time in 3 years, it has tripled its profitability and it is still promising to do it in the same way. Our heavy investment in Opex technology and data is delivering to desired results. While some of the investors may just monitor us on the basis of one number, some of them will look at the combination of all 3. But we will get there, what we have said. It may be just maybe by a quarter some time, but we can get accelerated also by a quarter sometimes.\n",

I'm not asking about the numbers, but are we having the enough infrastructure in the form of the branches at that point that financial year '25, we'll do some monthly reach? We must be having some monthly targets or quarterly targets. So are we having -- have you laid down the infrastructure to basically achieve it?\n",

      "Shachindra Nath: I'm coming to that, sir. We are delivering INR550 crores of gross disbursement, then there is repayment, there is foreclosure, and that comes to the net AUM increase. Now we have said that we are adding 75 more locations. Technically, we should be adding 200 more locations, given that we have strong underpenetration, which is in a micro enterprise segment, but that's the arbitrage between how much OpEx we can take versus just the AUM growth. Considering the increase of about 75 branches, our focus on the increased penetration of retailer financing, we are hoping that, from current INR550 crores, we hit the benchmark of INR750 crores per month and then INR1,000 crores per month, so that we can get back to near to what we aspire to be in next financial year, by end of next financial year. Only caveat being, it is also a function of overall liquidity into the market. We are feeling very confident that given the number of bank partnership which we have, our ability to do co-lend, our diversified lending book, we would be there, near to that, but we will also calibrate between just AUM growth to the profitability and we'll try to deliver both of it.\n",

      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (1.0)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Omkar: On net lower origination, I was looking at your mix for the last few quarters, so the secured -- prime secured disbursements have been coming down. It was INR360 crores in Q4, and currently it is around INR250 crores. Unsecured has been growing at a factor base from INR400-odd crores to INR600 crores in this quarter. How do we see this mix going ahead? Maybe is this our steady-state mix of originations.\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (0.999)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Amit Mande: So very well. This is a good question, why has secured come down over the last 2 quarters. We had 2 products in secured, if you've been following us, one was the prime secured and one was the affordable loan against properties, affordable lap called Saathi. Now now that you would have heard that our -- one of our fundamental pillars for the long-term loans, so that the long- term loans do not stay on our books, is co-lending. The affordable loan against property was typically a loan which is done on the periphery of the large cities, where the collateral may be not as prime as the collateral in the prime loans, where we also saw some resistance by some of the co-lending partners to onboard this collateral. In view of 2 things, one, wanting to generate our secured long-term business for co-lenders. Second, to ensure that our ALM on-book ALM remains -- does not get stranded by these long- term loans, we decided to scale down that part of our secured. What we are currently booking is the prime secured. And from here, this prime secured will continue to inch up quarter-on-quarter and come back to those INR360 crores levels, hopefully in this quarter itself.\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (0.809)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Shachindra Nath: If I may add to that, the way we look at is not by product but overall portfolio. Our philosophy is that, overall, we will try to have 70% portfolio in secured. And wherever there is an opportunity, lower-yielding segment would converge to higher-yielding segment. Our secured business is not just what segment which you are saying. Our micro enterprises is also secured. Our machinery is also secured. Our retail financing have cash flow attached to that. Now we have been balancing, that doing a 12% yield business, half of that which we based on our balance sheet versus doing higher-yielding business, which also has the capacity to go back to the banking co-lending system. What should we do? This is a planned transition of gradually happening. The way you should monitor us is on the blended portfolio of 70% remaining secured. That's why as we gradually a little bit taper down the loading portfolio to high-yielding, but secured portfolio, our overall portfolio yield also would increase. If you would have missed we said that by end of FY '25 we expect our yield -- portfolio yield to go up by 70 basis points to 100 basis points, and this is happening because of this gradual everyday transition, which we do.\n",

      "Kishore Lodha: Good evening to all the participants on behalf of UGRO Capital, we thank all the participants to take time out and participate in our investor concall for the result of this quarter. We continue with our growth momentum and have achieved an AUM of INR6,000+ crores versus INR3,000 crores last year registering a growth of ~105%. I will quickly run you‚Äôll through the financial performance for the quarter ended Q4FY23 and full year FY23. FY23 gross disbursement stood at around INR7,200 crores vis a vis INR3,138 crores during FY22. We have emerged as one of the fastest-growing and one of the largest Lending-as-a-Service providers in the MSME co- lending space where our total off-book AUM proportion is 40% and on book AUM proportion is about 60%. Our total income for FY23 increased by ~119% to INR 683 crores versus INR 312 crores in the previous year. Total net income increased by about 123% to INR 390 crores versus INR 175 crores of the previous year. Profit before tax has increased four fold to INR 83 crores versus INR 20 crores of the previous year and profit after tax stood at INR 39 crores versus INR 14 crores during the previous year. This year, we have taken a one-time hit of INR 20.6 crores as a write- off w.r.t deferred tax assets, if we adjust that then our profit after tax would have been INR 60 crores versus INR 14 crores of the previous year. The company has delivered a ROTA of 1.1% during the year. If we adjust with the deferred tax adjustment, then it would have been 1.7% vis-a-vis 0.6% in the previous year. As a result, this company has delivered an ROE of 4.1% and on an adjusted basis ROE stands at 6.2%vis a vis 1.5% during FY22. We have increased by fourfold in ROE as well. We have seen another good quarter in terms of profitability and QoQ profitability has steadily increased. Last quarter i.e. Q3‚ÄôFY23 our PBT was about ~ INR 22 crores where as this quarter, is the same is ~INR 33 crores. Our cost-to-income ratio is steadily going down. Last year, our cost-to-income ratio was ~72% and this year, we have brought it down to 62%.Our Q4‚ÄôFY23 cost to income ratio exit was roughly around 56%. In the guidance, we will continue to walk down this path and next yearour cost to income ratio will go down to ~47%. Our overall debt stood at around INR 3,149 crores as on March 31, 2023 and our Mar‚Äô23 leverage stood at 3.2x. Our capital adequacy was ~20% for the year ended March 31, 2023, this does not factor in the capital raise which we have done in the month of April and May. As you all of you must be aware that in the month of April, we have raised INR 340 crores through a combination of Preferential Issue and QIP, INR 240 crores has been raised through Preferential issue where Denmark government backed sovereign fund IFU has participated and invested INR 240 crores and our QIP amounting to ~INR 100 Cr was completed during the month of April where funds were raised from domestic institutions and some of the large insurance companies participated as primary participants of the issue. Overall, the credit quality has remained quite stable. Our gross NPA as a % of Total AUM has come down from 2.0% to 1.6%and our net NPA has decreased from 1.6% to 0.9%, which is quite healthy. PCR has gone up from 26% to 48% during the year. Borrowing cost has remained more or less stable for us. During the quarter, the borrowing cost has increased by ~7 bps from 10.50% to 10.57%. On full year basis, where the overall rate has increased by 225 bps for the broader market our overall borrowing costs has gone up from 10.30% to 10.57%, registering only ~ 27 bps increase in borrowing cost. With this, I hand it over to our Vice Chairman and the Managing Director, Mr. Shachindra Nath, to take you through our journey so far and our plans ahead. Over to you Mr. Nath.\n",

      "Shachindra Nath: Thank you, Kishore. Before actually, we start the formal presentation all of you normally see the quarterly result presentation, which is all about the numbers. As a young company, which has just started its journey four years back, we recently launched our brand campaign, and we wanted to show you the campaign itself. The reason that why we wanted to show you the campaign is because we provide a unique proposition for our customers and we have tried to portray that proposition through what goes in lending when we provide instant credit. So, it's a film about a business owner inquiring about the unavailability of raw material due to shortage of funds. He sends an SOS via his mobile phone, which is represented in a bottled message and is picked up by a pelican. How an analyst represented by rooster, an emperor, how the KYC, how the large portion of data is used and then within minutes, the credit is delivered is represented by this film. Please watch. [Video Presentation] Thanks. Moving on, MSMEs in India have traditionally been a credit starved business segment. While MSMEs employ~110 million people and account for ~30% of the country's GDP they have generally suffered difficult time because of the late payment, and disputes which suffocate their cash flow. Lending institutions have largely been reliant on collateral to provide loans to MSME segment and this is now transitioning. We genuinely believe that the next decade or two decades belong to MSME financing in India. We have seen this for consumer financing and multiple institutions have been built around it that same thing will now happen for MSME financing wherein a few set digitalized data lenders would explode the credit for MSME. With the advent of GST smaller entities are now finding it advantageous to report top line, resulting in very robust compliance. If you combine multiple other data set which is the banking data, repayment behaviour from Bureau and now more inputs which are getting added, and if you have the ability to combine all this then you can genuinely assess the repayment capacity of a borrower. While all of us as lenders continue to do pure cash flow-based lending with collateral but eventually our belief is that lending would not remain restricted purely basis the collateral. There is a massive ecosystem around, OCEN, and Account Aggregation that is getting built up. UGRO is a pioneer in most of that and the following video will showcase how actually it is functioning before we do a quick deep dive in terms of what we have built around it. [Video Presentation] Thank you. I now hand over the conference to Mr. Anuj Pandey. Anuj, as you know is our Chief Risk Officer, our entire technology team and our data analytics team report to him.

      "Anuj Pandey: Thank you, Shachin. Good evening, everyone. This is a good opportunity to look back, and I wanted to tell you all when we had started in 2018, our mission what we used to call it was ‚ÄúSolving the Unsolved‚Äù and that solution in our mind was to make a scientific template around underwriting MSMEs, which is sustainable and scalable. In the next few slides, I will demonstrate and tell you what all we have achieved in that direction. This is a short highlight slide on how we have scaled up and how the data system and ecosystem around us has also evolved. Just to give you a few numbers in the last four years, our proprietary GRO score has been applied to 63,000 plus customers. We have analysed more than 1.9 lakh Bureau records. We have analysed more than 93,000 bank statements, and we have analysed more than 34,000 GST records. This has happened because we have been able to make a platform where onboarding of documents by customer has been made seamless with a click of button, and on the back end, there is a technology module, which is working tirelessly 24/7. This has resulted in UGRO having 48,000 live customers. The gross banking turnover of the customers whom we serve is now close to 1.6 lakh crores. We are into about 25% of the top pin codes in the country where the SME concentration is high. We serve 115+ anchors and OEMs but what I'm most excited to share is what the future is looking like and the power of network science, which we now have the capability to see and in very short future to encash. Just to illustrate to you today in our network of customers, we have demographic records of 25+ lakh counterparties. We cover more than 10% of India's registered companies and this is what happens when we are reaching a tipping point and where because of the GST linkages in the ecosystem, we will be able to identify and solve customers' working capital needs across the trade corridor. Today, in our network, we cover more than 95% of India's top 500 companies and 19% of all GST registered companies are in one way or other part of the GST ecosystem of the companies, which we serve directly. We have it all set, our data science team is working on cutting-edge solutions and we are very confident that our stated goal of serving at least 1% of MSMEs lending market will be solved in near future. What we will do now is give you a glimpse of our latest version of GRO Score, which we internally call GRO Score 3.0 and what it is capable of. So, we'll start the video. [Video Presentation] So, you would have watched the video. I'll take a few minutes more to explain the building blocks of our flagship GRO Score 3.0. This is at the very heart of the underwriting model which we have developed for SMEs. At the very basic, our GRO Score is based on three components. We use GST transaction data for last 24 months, which is available on a click of button through consent of the customer. We take last 12 months bank statement of the customer, which, again, today is possible with a click of a button and the repayment history of the customer from the credit Bureau. Our belief right from day one was that we should take the documents, which are very easy to upload for the customer and at the same time, gives us the most accurate picture of the current cash flows. So, all our modelling has been done basis these three document sets. Currently we are in the third generation that's why it's GRO Score 3.0, what we have done during the course is that we have invested a lot and developed a very large library, which we call feature liability. What it does is it looks at all the possible parameters in the repayment history or in the banking transaction or the GST transaction, which can have correlation with the future repayment behaviour of the customer. And then we allow this data feature library to be accessed by the in- house developed machine learning platform. What it does is it keeps triangulating this data and keeps checking with the corresponding future portfolio behaviour of the customer and during this process, it comes up with a scorecard incorporating the most important characteristics. The beauty of this model is that it keeps evolving on its own. The GRO Score today, which we have made has the ability to predict probability of default for the next 12 months. So typically we allow it to run for at least a year, look at the results and then the machine weighs in on how accurate it was and if required, changes itself. So, this is a self-sustaining model and it has a capacity to keep enriching itself as more and more data feature is discovered. Finally, it's very important that we keep checking whether the GRO Score, which we have developed has been working well or not and for that, we have arrived at a framework where not only we keep checking the repayment behaviour of the customers whom we approved but also we keep checking the repayment behaviour of the customers whom we have rejected. This allows us to not only get data of our own disbursements but also what the customer and how the customer is behaving with other financiers. Just to illustrate the same we have made a very simple two-line graphs. The bottom line is the portfolio behaviour of the customers whom we have disbursed by the risk banks of GRO Score. Our GRO Score gives classification of customer in five risk banks, A, B, C, D & E. A being the best customer, the probability of default for the next 12 months would be the least and E being the worst customer where the probability of default in the next 12 months will be higher. The picture on the left-hand side illustrates that the risk ranking and the portfolio behaviour as predicted by our GRO Score across risk banks A, B, C, D, E is not only holding for our own customers, but also for the customers who were scored but not disbursed. Across the width of the data, which is available, it is a proof that it is working well. On the right- hand side, we have demonstrated the portfolio contribution by GRO Score. And currently, approximately 88% of the portfolio customers have a GRO Score of A & B, which is very encouraging because we know that overall, the portfolio performance will continue to do well. Thank you. Now I hand over the mic to Amit, and he will take you through more business details. Over to you, Amit.\n",

      "Amit Mande: So, thank you. Thank you all for joining the call. As we move ahead, I just wanted to run you through our journey for last five years. This five years journey has been nothing but eventful. As you would recollect, we raised our first capital in July 2018, a capital raise of ~INR 900 crores, and we set foot for this interesting journey to really empower the MSME ecosystem. During these first six months, we built risk models, we built an entire sectoral approach and we disbursed our first loan in Jan '19. I think after that setup phase when we were ready to really scale up, we saw two macroeconomic events, which were disruptive and that changed that kind of changed the course. We had IL&FS crisis that happened and then, of course, in March 2020, COVID set in and by then we had created a book of ~ INR 860 crores. Once COVID set in we took a little pause and with the power of capital behind us we decided to invest our time and energies into building infrastructure, hire the right set of people, built our technology stacks and continuously enriched our risk models. Once we had built these blocks during our COVID times and once COVID was past us we started our growth phase. Since Q3FY21 we have been growing at a brisk pace. All our asset engines and our investments in infra and technology have been reaping benefits. People who have been following us would see that our AUM has steadily increased since then and we crossed INR 6,000 crores AUM this March. As we now go forward, we will continue to harness the efficiency of our GRO Score 3.0 model. We will continue to scale our Lending-as- a-Service model where we will have multiple partnerships on co-lending and co-origination. More importantly, now that we have launched our direct-to-customer model, we will start acquiring large number of customers, which will only enrich our ecosystem that Anuj spoke about through network sciences and ensure that we become a data powers for the MSMEs. Now that we're also supported by the capital raise that just happened in April, we look forward to a great FY24. Very quickly in terms of the last three pillars that will help us grow next year at the centre of course is the key and our proprietary GRO Score 3.0 model. Our asset side continues to grow with INR 4,500 crores of net disbursements last year and INR 1,400+ -crores of net disbursements in Q4FY23. Somewhere the exit run rates in March are between INR 550 crores to INR 600 crores and they will continue to slowly inch up and that gives a sense of where we will reach by end of next year, somewhere in the five-digit AUM range. We will continue to strengthen our infrastructure and our digital platforms and ensure that the current opex delivers far more than what we delivered last year. On the other side, our liability platform is only getting robust by each passing day, apart from the 10 co-lending and co- origination partners that support our Lending-as-a-Service model. We have 66 lenders on board and our liability is only looking robust by the day. With these three pillars of a strong asset engine, a robust risk model and our robust liability engine that is ready to power our asset engine, growth I think next year looks extremely promising for all of us at UGRO. Having said this, I will now open the floor for questions. I will let the moderator instruct the participants on how to take it forward.\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (1.0)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Moderator: Thank you very much. We'll take our first question from the line of Rishi Kesh, a Retail Investor.\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (1.0)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Rishi Kesh: Congratulations on a great set of numbers yet again. I do have a couple of questions with regards to how the business on the GRO X is going to be like? I mean do we have control over what the funds are being used when it's app-based lending or is it on a particular purpose where we actually end up paying their vendors or their suppliers?\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (1.0)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Shachindra Nath: So, this app-based lending, which we have launched, is basically to serve the need of very small merchant. Think of a scenario of a small retail store, which does daily buying in the morning and does sales for a whole day and next day morning or two days when he has excess cash he wants to return the money. He can get the credit limit uploaded into the app, he can use and dispense money through UPI and other method. At the time of dispensation of our credit, we will not be able to control where the money is going. But what we can control is that we are only aligned with Udyam Aadhar registered entities to avail the credit, which means that the credit is being given only to a business entity, and it is not a loan for consumption purposes, it's not a personal loan. Over a period of time and that is what differentiates banks and us, we will try to perfect and we will do very specific need-based lending. But at the initial phase where we want to get more customer, we want our data to get more mature, we have not defined it for the end purpose, but we have a presumption is that 80% to 90% loan given to business entity would be used for business purposes only.\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (1.0)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Rishi Kesh: Understood. I have another question. So, is there any statistics available on how the GRO Xstream platform is currently performing without U GRO being a part of the deal, like deals between NBFCs and banks, where you grow it just taking a fee?\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (1.0)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Shachindra Nath: No, sir. We have not opened our platform for that purpose. We are still not a platform play. GRO Xstream platform predominantly connects our distribution and origination to our bank partner. Some of the banks actually are using third-party platform because they don't want to connect to just one lenders' platform and so as other lenders also don't want to connect to one lender platform. Till the time we fully mature, we have not monetized the platform as a platform play. It is currently playing a role of facilitation for UGRO ecosystem.\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (1.0)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Rishi Kesh: Understood. One final question, if I may. So, this is on the equity fund raise that was recently done from the Danish government. So, I was trying to understand the background for this. I mean, it is a substantial dilution in terms of them becoming almost the largest shareholders now. Does this mean they would participate in future rounds like to reduce our cost of capital by way of bonds or foreign currency bonds or NCDs? Is that envisioned to happen like that?\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (0.926)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Shachindra Nath: They are not our largest shareholder, sir. Their shareholder is exactly equal to what TPG and ADV Capital have. So, they will also be roughly around 16.5% on here about so as the TPG and ADV as well. Our purpose in this round of capital was to ensure that on our cap table, we have a certain number of shareholders who have longevity of duration because lending as a business is a business of duration. That's why we found it appropriate to attract DFIs because, as you know, sovereign entities have the capacity to hold the equity stake for a very, very long period of time. Second, one of the source of our financing is impact financing because we are building a very robust impact financing business and also, we are focusing on renewable and sustainability and that's why as the third largest European DFI invests in us, our recognition within the DFI world would increase with them coming on our capital structure. We see that during this year, almost all large DFIs would be on the lender side. Generally, sir, in the DFI parallels, when they take the equity exposure, it is calculated as 4x to debt exposure, and it actually reduces their capacity of providing debt to us. So, most of them whether it is IFU, DEG, Proparco, IFC when they put in equity money, they don't put debt money simultaneously. But what we have also seen and we have seen this during the period of COVID very effectively is that DFIs generally support their existing, what they call client at the time of stress. So, all DFIs in the world have special programs for their existing client during COVID period, and they support all their portfolio companies through debt support at that period of time and that's why we feel confident that at the point of time, when we need money, investors like IFU would be very, very supportive.\n",

      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (1.0)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Nirvana Laha: So, how do you see the cost of borrowing trending in FY24? And another question on the cost front, how many branches do you see opening beyond 98 and FY24?\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (1.0)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Kishore Lodha: So, as we have recently seen that inflation is coming slowly under control. April month inflation numbers are very encouraging, where the retail inflation has come down to 4.7%. And in fact, WPI has gone into negative, which has happened after almost 18 months. And RBI has also taken a pause in their last meeting. What we internally believe in general release in the borrowing market is that we have upgraded as far as the cost of borrowing is concerned. From here on, we may see some amount of stability where the cost will remain similar, which is of course is on the higher side and then we may see a cycle of lowering down, which is the early period. For this year we don't anticipate a significant increase in the cost of borrowing and for our purpose, we have taken it as flattish. On number of branches and cost of opex, Amit can take.\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (0.982)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Amit Mande: On the number of branches, one would have seen that over last year post Q1, we really did not set up any new branches and the number has been stagnant and there was a reason. We set up about 75 branches in Q4FY22 and the early part of FY23. and we wanted to see the proof of concept that these branches can breakeven between 12 to 15 months. These were essentially the micro enterprise loan branches, the 75 branches that we have in Rajasthan, Gujarat, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Telangana. As we now approach about 12 months, we've seen that most of our branches have actually reached the breakeven point. Our average productivity of branches is higher than our peer set. So now we are confident that we will be able to now scale up. We will give another quarter or so for this to really mature and understand that all our branches breakeven. Having said this, in the first two quarters, we will open between 20 to 25 micro enterprises branches, and we will take a call in the last quarter on further expansion. Eventually, in the next 24 to 30 months, we will have about total 250 branches across the country.\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (0.996)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Nirvana Laha: Okay. And with that number, do you think you are on track to hit the cost-to-income ratio that you've targeted for FY25 or are you running above budget?\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (0.964)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Amit Mande: No, absolutely. Like I said, we are only talking about 20 incremental micro enterprise branches, which are low cost branches that we will be expanding. So opex in that sense is really flat this year and with the AUM growth happening we will see our cost-to-income ratio touch the desired levels of 47% more a year.\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (1.0)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Nirvana Laha: Okay. One more follow-up question on the branches. So, the prime branches, you say that it's intermediated. So, can you explain what that means? Is it 100% DSA or is it through our own employees?\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (1.0)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Amit Mande: Prime branches have multiple products. It has standard loan against property and unsecured loans as one set of product. It also has equipment finance and supply chain finance as the ecosystem products in the prime branches that we do. The prime products or rather those against property and the business on products are DSA-driven and intermediated. The equipment finance, the supply chain and our direct-to-customer product, there is no intermediation. The prime branches house both these businesses, and so in that ratio, it does have the intermediate business.\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (1.0)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Nirvana Laha: Okay. So, at an overall disbursement level, can you tell us what percentage is sourced through DSAs and what percentage is sourced through our own employees?\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (1.0)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Amit Mande: 56% at this point of time on the overall disbursement is intermediated. The rest is direct.\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (1.0)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Shachindra Nath: I must add, intermediated doesn't mean that we don't have distribution cost or sales front end. Actually, a large portion of our sales forces and what we call the upper end of the sales force, relative per person cost being higher are actually in prime branches because there is a twin level of servicing, which is required because we compete with the intermediaries because they are open architecture intermediaries to get to the door and then ultimately serve the customer to get them accept our offer and take the loan. So actually, only the hunting part is not done by us. But post origination by the intermediary to get to the client to our system is all done by our sales forces.\n",

      "Nirvana Laha: Okay. Got it. Final question from my side last quarter, I think you had confirmed that the tax rates from the lapse DTAs are over. So, can you just confirm that for this FY24? Are we foreseeing any further taxes?\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (1.0)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Kishore Lodha: No sir, actually the carry forward deferred tax, which is still there in the balance sheet is about INR 10 crores, out of which INR 6.9 crores is coming for lapse in the coming year. So, a profit has to absorb it for the year FY24.\n",

      "Anuj Pandey: So, we keep evaluating sectors. At this point of time, we have nine sectors. Eight sectors which we started with and ninth we added during the course of the journey and also, as a policy of about 20% of our total portfolio, we have deliberately kept it open for all other sectors so that whenever we choose to open, we have some kind of data to make room. At this point in time, with the state of macro economy and the way the sectors are performing, we are not thinking of opening up anything new. Within the light engineering sectors and electrical equipment, there have been very interesting subsectors, which have opened up, especially on green energy and solar. Those are part of our large sector list and have opened newer opportunities for us. For the near to medium term, we don't see any reason to open a new sector but of course, we will keep exploring interesting opportunities within other sectors which we work with.\n",

We are slightly ahead of time in terms of achieving our off-book numbers. This year, we have reached slightly more than what we have envisaged on off-book side. Next year, we will reach closer to 47% on off-book and 53% will remain on balance sheet. But I think our goal is to reach 50-50.\n",

So, the INR 340 crores, which has come in that would be the only equity in season for this 12 months starting from April 2023 and balance of the entire balance sheet growth would come from debt.

I get the gist of your question, broadly, you are asking by this band if the probability of default for next 12 months at a portfolio level was X percent. After 12 months, what do you see?

      "Shachindra Nath: Okay. So, there are multiple ways people make convention centres, right, or make banquet hall. So, think of somebody making a small banquet hall then that goes to full capacity, then they make another banquet hall and then make a third banquet hall. But it may so happen that the land parcel near to your first banquet hall may not be available. So that's the one way to do it and second is, you have seen Jio's Convention Centre, right, wherein you take large land parcel and you make a large convention centre and such large convention centre and such large convention centre it would happen that in first event itself would have 5, 7 lakh people coming into that. So UGRO has been designed and built like that. We've raised a significant amount of capital without having any business, right, on a piece of paper, INR 900 crores equal capital. Then we bought all the land and we'll build a large building. And now that large building is being utilized for this capacity. So, our growth rate is not a function of surprise. It is a function of upfront capacity, which has been built. Personally speaking, I still think so that our capacity is underutilized, and it's a function of our liability funnel, and we could have been much better. We are growing at this rate when you've just heard that our approval rate is only 30%. So, for a month of March, when we dispersed INR600-odd- crores, we originated INR 2,000 crores loan. So, which means that we have kept our credit completely tight, but still the funnel is very big, and that's why it is throwing big numbers. Second question, and Kishore can give you the numbers is, again, the same. Because you have built all capacity upfront, then obviously, that upfront capacity would yield a little bit of time to generate the bottom-line performance. So, this company has moved from a INR 20 crores of PBT last year to INR 84 crores this year and as you have just heard the commentary from Amit that now we are not increasing the opex and on the current run rate basis, we will touch roughly around INR 10,000 crores of AUM, which means your bottom-line performance from the current INR 84 crores would be at least 2.5x, 3x. So, we would be into the median ROE, a two-digit ROE number in the current year and we'll be near to high double-digit ROE number a year forward, Kishore, if I'm correct.\n",

But overall, from modelling perspective for each of our business verticals, we have a budget or NPA budget, and that is how the GRO Score models have been worked out. So as a general philosophy for an unsecured business at a yield of 19%, we are okay to go up to 3%, 3.5% NPA lifetime. For a secured loan backed by a hard collateral-like property, we are fine to go up to 0.5% to 0.75% NPA in the lifetime. So far, we have been well below that. Our scores and our underwriting has been calibrated so that we don't cross these benchmarks. The absolute number of GNPA has increased, but as a percentage, it has come down, and that is how this has to be looked at.\n",

Probably in the mid of next year, we will look at another round of equity for the growth capital. On the interest rate side, of course, that can be used by anyone. As an institution we believe and we are looking upon is that we have proven our sales to the markets, to our lenders with our transparency, our governance and robustness of our underwriting model, and it will pay a dividend at some point of time. And I personally believe that time has arrived where people would give some premiums of all the efforts that hard work that have gone into this company for the last four years. The robust underwriting model that it has created, the governance model company has been demonstrating over the entire journey of five years and our transparency in disclosure and data to all sets of investors, whether it is equity investors, all our lenders, where we will get some advantage. So this is my personal belief, there is no signs around it, that I really believe that our cost of funds should come down proportion to the markets, positive to open market, where rates can go up and down, but we will have some advantage over our peers as we move forward.\n",

      "Shachindra Nath: If I may add, Mr. Jain, I think so one of the cardinal principle of lending is vintage. So, there are two formats of businesses. Businesses, wherein the cost of borrowing is a function of parentage. So, there are entities which may be much younger, five years, six years, we have a cost of borrowing which reflects the cost of borrowing of who their parent is. Obviously, they have a disproportionate advantage vis a vis us, but actually they are our partners, most of them. All those such entities are actually doing business with us, so that shows our capability. Second, there is always an inflection point. I will give you an example of AU, which in the first 10 years of its journey, actually started as a BBB- company and then went to a AA+. In current world, look at Five Star, which is into the microest of the micro-enterprises segment, which was started as a double BB+ company and now double AA- company. As long as you continue on your vintage journey, maintain credit costs, create healthy growth and generate bottom line performance, your cost of borrowing and rating, both would start improving. So, I think so with every passing year, that would keep happening for us, like it has happened for many other institutions in India.\n",

      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Shachindra Nath: I can take that. So, look, the way the co-lending for regulations have been formulated and where it get differentiated between a direct assignment or a portfolio sale, banks as under the RBI circular of co-lending, which is November 2020, are mandated to do customer level underwriting. So, there are two things which banks have to do. One, they have to pre-agree the policy framework under which the loan would be given. So now actually all the banks look at our policy and with some variation actually adopt our policy. This is the biggest change which has come because of our vintage of portfolio or portfolio performance, more or less they are aligning them themselves to our policy. Then once we disburse a customer, when the file moves either through technology or through, digital formats, then they are obligated to check every parameter of the policy and whether the loan is as per policy or not. So, to that extent it isn't work which banks have to do and this is where banking system is getting more comfortable because they are taking actual customer level risk and not the entity level risk. So that is the way, you know, it is happening right now. Kishore, if you want to add or Amit you want to add something?\n",

So, if I look at this absolute GNPA against one year ago, AUM of INR 1,000 crores prime unsecured, it is 5.5%. And even if I take six month ago, AUM of INR 1,200 crores, roughly 4.5% GNPA, the lagged GNPA. So, comments on this, is it, do you think at least in your view, is it deterioration in asset quality, one? Two, the components in our borrowing, are they for overall AUM or is it product specific?\n",

So sourcing post-COVID, post-reimplemented those code 2.0 is actually very, very healthy. And we have hardly seen anything. So, to your question of how do we foresee this, we will see some bit of recovery because some of those restructured stress portfolio also are now coming back alive. But on the new portfolio source, and we have been tracking this on vintage curves very, very closely, we don't foresee the gross NPAs for lifetime to go above 3% to 3.5%.\n",

      "Anuj Pandey: So, to answer the first question first, now we are hitting kind of our desired numbers on provision coverage. We are actually quite comfortable internally. We have benchmarked it to between 45% to 50%. It is actually a function of the portfolio mix in stage 3, the kind of products and the kind of estimates from the ground of how our litigation and collection action is taking through. On a broad level, for unsecured, the provision coverage is closer to 65% to 70%. On secured, it will be closer to between 20% to 30%.\n",

      "Sanjay Elangovan: Just a product-specific question, sir. So GNPA is also higher in supply chain financing, although the yields are very similar to your prime secured kind of wheel. So why is this divergence, sir? And why are the yields so high in micro enterprise loans?\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (0.85)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Anuj Pandey: So, I'll answer the second question first. On the micro segment, we do secured loans up to INR 25 lakh for micro enterprises at on an average yield of about 21%. And we do unsecured loans up to INR 5 lakh, specifically for micro enterprises at around 24%. So that's the way market is. When the way we have defined this is on measuring the quality of cash flow, the quality of collateral and the quality of repayment behaviour. For micro customers, all these three are not standard and less than prime and that is how the risk-based pricing has been arrived at. On the supply chain, yes, you're right. The NPAs are higher but if you would have seen our journey, this is on account of two large anchors going bust just before COVID. And this NPA number used to be around a little higher than 4%. We have been successfully able to recover part of that stressed assets. And in the next two to three quarters, it is expected that we will recover more. For everything sourced after that, we have hardly seen any forward flows.\n",

      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Shachindra Nath: Last part of your question, which you asked that yields look similar to some of our other secured products. Actually, we are graduating from a vendor-based financing to purchase based financing, which means that we are now financing the distribution chains of anchors. So, anchor to distributor, distributor to retailer. That's why you will see an uptick in the yields curve. Second, sir, we look at price and duration both. So, one of the great advantage of supply chain portfolio is its duration because it's a short tenured duration because we have to ensure that we have all liquidity profile of assets in our balance sheet because on the liability side also, we get all kind of duration of loans. So just having only long duration loans are not sustainable if you're not a bank. So that's why we mix product by LGD calculation, by collateral, we mix product by duration and we also look at what gives us the broad market access. Some of our products, supply chain, machinery finance, GRO X, actually our products which are bringing the funnel of large customer bases, wherein in future, massive cross-sell would happen. Every supply chain financing or a dealer or a retailer is a customer where in 12 months to 18 months time, I would be able to cross-sell a machine. I'll be able to cross-sell a rooftop solar. I will be able to cross-sell a secured loan, so on and so forth. So, I think, sir, that is the philosophy of why we are doing certain businesses.\n",

Going forward, we don't see too many changes in this kind because the way the portfolio construct is and in each product the way the risk cut-offs are for approvals and rejects. On the collection infrastructure, we have a very large in-house team headed by a large litigation team and an early warning system, which is developed by the in-house analytics team, which gives early warning signals for the current assets to the in-house call centre.

In GRO Score 3.0, what we have done is we have added that as a statistical parameter and all the data features, which can emanate from the GST return, we have added that. The primary hypothesis is that the earliest warning signal for a stressed customer is not the Bureau, not the banking but the GST. Bureau takes typically four to five months lag before a stress is reported. Banking early warning is a little better but still, one doesn't know till the cheque bounces. In GST, the moment the sale starts going down, that is the first and your primary early warning signal. This was our hypothesis and with this, we build and included that as a major parameter in GRO Score.\n",

And all that always happens to the private sector banks so that's point number one. Number two, you're also making the same assumption and the presumption that private sector banks are superior when it comes to their understanding of the credit. But you should also remember all of the people who are seeing over here and the rest of the 1,700, 1,800 people who work for UGRO also have come from the same set of the bank. So, in terms of the intellectual calibre, in terms of the years which we have spent is no less than the banks. Number three, why actually the first quote of call for us is public sector bank because in India, the custodian of the money is public sector bank because general public have more trust and faith in the public sector banking system so the liquidity always flows to them, but that does not necessarily mean that they have the same comparable infrastructure on the asset side. That's why they are hungrier on the asset side than the private sector banks and third, in last five to seven years, majority of the private sector banks have grown on the basis of wholesale credit, and that's why this half decade or next four, five years, they are very, very focused on retail growth of their own. And that's why there is less motivation for them to add indirect sources of origination like co- lending, but since all of you keep asking this question over a period of this and next quarter, there'll be at least two to three private sector banks, which we would add. We have more number of private sector banks coming to us, but we have exhausted our asset side capacity to take on more co-lending partners.

      "Shachindra Nath: I would take that and Amit you can add on to that. Number one, I think so Bajaj democratized the consumer credit in India starting from 2008 till 2023. In 2008, it was roughly around INR 7,500 crores, it is at INR 2,50,000 crores or INR 2,75,000 crores so an exponential growth of 45% CAGR continuously for almost 15 years. That has happened because of three things: Bajaj brand, cost of capital; and third, their early adoption of data, but that data was consumer-related data, Bureau, existing loan data, which they had and consumer behaviour and that automated credit for consumer-related loans. I think our MOAT is that what Bajaj was able to do in 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, post Global Financial Crisis and what we have been able to create post-COVID crisis is exactly same. So, our MOAT is that when it comes to the MSME financing in India, we have a five year of head start in understanding the data and underwriting credit on the basis of data and which any other player into the market have to catch up with us. So that's one. Second, you took two names on the tech driven NBFC, only one of them is NBFC. Other is only pure originator, so I won't comment on that.\n",

      "Moderator: We have a text question from Chetan Bharat from Vishnu Bharat & Company. Has the RBI started discouraging co-lending? If yes, how does it affect you U GRO?\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (0.599)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Shachindra Nath: RBI is encouraging co-lending, sir. So, I think one media report in Hindu Business line, which has not been verified by anyone and from RBI does not mean that RBI has discouraging co- lending. If you look at from a policy perspective, government ease 4.0 has a stated objective of increasing the credit dissemination for priority sector through co-lending. It has a very well- defined philosophy by both policy, which is the government and the regulator want to increase the penetration of co-lending. This emanated from the default which happened from DHFL and a few other large NBFCs. Banks exposure to NBFC, one has a 100% risk weight. Second, bank's ability to control the enterprise level risk is very, very limited. So, to balance that out and recognition of the fact that NBFC actually do the credit dissemination part to the deserving sector, which otherwise banks are not being able to do, this marriage was consummated. So, this was an arrangement marriage done by the regulator and the government, and it was not a love marriage to begin with, but it is converging to love marriage and I don't think so there is any apprehension or a rethinking from a policy perspective. But every time, this is the job of the regulator, that anything when it grows, regulator has to ensure that the checks and balances are being maintained and nobody is exploiting the system. But that's the journey that has happened for direct assignment that has happened for securitization that keep happening for every product into the market. But I would continue to believe that we have just seen tip of the iceberg. My presumption in next two, three years at the current base ofthe newspaper report, which has quoted some numbers, you will see at least 10- fold jumps from there.\n",

You just said that CIL may have exited because of quick price jump of mere 10%, which is negligible for a long-term investor. It appears from the trade that this apparently is a negotiated deal. Since the company knows CIL as they are your old investors is it in your knowledge who is the new investor?\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (0.905)\n",

      "Shachindra Nath: Yes. So, this is true. Actually, CIL has been invested in our first series of capital raise. They also came in this round as well. And at the time of our QIP, we had more demand than what we have decided the QIP. And actually, CIL has already committed. Our belief is that, and we have not confirmed it with CIL and have not looked at data that some of the very large marquee public market investors have negotiated and bought that stake, and that's why they were also willing to sell that stake to them.\n",

In the road map 2025 slides shared earlier, you have mentioned a target of INR 20,000-plus-crores AUM by FY '25. To reach that number, AUM after FY '23 was supposed to be INR 7,000-plus-crores. We are around INR 900 crores short of that target. So, are we still targeting INR 20,000 crores AUM for FY'25 or that number will be revised?\n",

      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Shachindra Nath: So, I think, when we gave our two-year number, that was in the context of -- at that point of time, because our base was very small. We had a large capital. We have an AUM of INR 1,300- only-odd-crores and when we were giving big numbers informally that this is the aspiration of ours, people who are not presuming. We wanted to put out that number that this company its capital structure, its opex structure, is tech and people infrastructure is designed for a sizable organization. So, I think we build businesses as entrepreneurs for decades and multi-decades and we are building a generational institution. So INR 1,000 crores short in a one year and INR 2,000 crores excess in another year, actually doesn't matter. We are broadly in line to that aspirational number and even much bigger than that. But we will see. Every year is a year which we have to pass and we have to complete that journey and there are multiple factors which play in that liability, macros, overall economic scenario, interest rate cycle, but all things remaining stable, we'll be very near to that number.\n",

      "Shachindra Nath: Good evening to all participants. Thanks for spending time to listen to our results for this quarter. We have delivered as per our plans, which has been made public. But before that, for those who might be joining new, I would like to take you through the journey of U GRO in few words. U GRO was set up as India's first listed vehicle, which is started fresh. We acquired a small listed NBFC in 2018, and raised approximately INR 950-plus crores of equity capital from globally-acclaimed private equity investors. We started our lending journey in Jan 2019, which was just post IL&FS crisis. In three years of our inception, we have seen through many other crises, like DHFL, Yes Bank, COVID and all other kind of other challenges for FinTechs and NBFC. For all of us here and for our customers, this has been one of the most difficult time. Still, we have persevered and crossed the milestone of INR 5,000 crores of assets under management and 38,000 customers, maintaining the credit cost under control. This, among our peer set, is the most accelerated build-up of a lending business, in this segment. This is the result of overinvesting in our operating infrastructure, data analytical infrastructure and distribution architecture, and we are seeing the results on asset growth and bottom line performance. Since our inception, we were and continue to be, of the opinion that India's small business lending is at inflection point of explosion. We have seen a 1.5 decade of consumer financing growth. And now you would see a similar growth for small business financing. This is happening on the back of being able to underwrite an SME customer, through the lens of fast emerging data stack underpinned by GST, digital banking, maturity of bureau, coupled with deep data analytical progress, which can underwrite the cash flow and not just the collateral. In addition to this, we believe that every small customer is different, and they are not homogenous. Therefore, you have to evaluate them with sectors and sub-sectors. We therefore built our credit scoring model, GRO Score, which uses the data of GST, banking and bureau and our underwriters use our sector and subsector-based templated underwriting scorecard. We have one of the largest data analytics and technology teams, for a company of our size and vintage. We always believed that data and technology will drive the MSME lending in India and true to our belief, the entire ecosystem is now transitioning to an on-tap financing similar to what we have seen in consumer lending many years back. Our credit scoring model, which provides a decision within 60 minutes is now well accepted across lenders and our co-lending partners. In last few calls, I did mention that India's NBFC lending model is transitioning from an on- balance sheet to an off-balance sheet lending. And U GRO is leading this transition as a leader. So on one side, we have the strength of serving the MSME through multiple product, and on the other side, we have our co-lending and liability partners. We have been investing heavily in teams and distribution network and taking all the costs upfront by creating a franchise which has a strength to now originate loan in excess of INR 600 crores per month. Banks lending to NBFC like us will take another shape in the form of co-lending and here again, we have seen the changes over the last many months. We continue to maintain a healthy mix of on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet risk by sharing our co-lending and co-origination partnership with more than 10 of the large banks and multiple large NBFCs. As we speak, our off-book AUM ratio has reached 35%, which we had targeted to achieve by March '23. With respect to the on-balance sheet liability, U GRO is one of the few companies, who have been backed by 65-plus lenders, in a short span of time. Our total off-book volume was INR 724 crores compared to INR 590 crores in Q2. The breakup of INR 720 crores was co-lending of INR 273 crores, direct assignment of INR 108 crores, and this was supported by co-origination of INR 343 crores. Income of co-lending and direct assignment is recognized upfront, on the basis of discount rate. However, for the co- origination incomes, it accrues to us over life of loan as if the loans were on our balance sheet. Over our four-year journey of precise execution and a process-driven approach, U GRO, today, has become a large-scale MSME lending platform, comprising INR 5,000 crores of asset under management, INR 1,800 crores of quarterly disbursements, 100 branches, 38,000 customers and more than 1,500 employees. While our numbers have been made available to you, I would share few highlights. Momentum in growth of AUM and disbursement, our total AUM increased to INR 5,095 crores from INR 4,370 crores in last quarter, up by 16% quarter-on-quarter. We have recorded the highest ever disbursement in Q3, which is stood at INR 1,874 crores for the quarter, which is 13% higher than the last quarter. Growth in terms of the total net income, our net total income has increased to INR 108 crores for Q3 versus vis-a-vis 24% in Q2 '23. As a percentage of on-book AUM, the net total income increased to 12.9% from 11.3%, in last quarter. Our opex and cost-to-income ratio stood at 63.9% in Q3 '23 as compared to 62.7% in Q2 '23, primarily on account of certain one-off expenses being recognized in the quarter. Adjusted for this one-off expenses, our cost-to-income ratio would have been around 60%. The employee cost month-on-month basis have been stable. \\ Our path to the higher RoA and RoE and profitability, the trend is very clear. Our PBT has increased to INR 22.2 crores in Q3 '23, registering a 27% quarter-on-quarter growth. And our PAT for Q3 '23 stood at INR 13.1 crores, registering a 149% quarter-on-quarter increase. Our cost of borrowing has seen no significant increase. We have a very well-diversified base of 65- plus lenders, including some of the largest banks in NBFC. While the cost of borrowing has remained at 10.5%, for most of the other players, it has increased by 100 basis point or more, while our cost has increased only by 20 basis point in last two quarters. And the last but not least, the disbursement in the Lending-as-a-Service or what we call the co-lending model, we have seen our total off-book portfolio increase to INR 1,775 crores, which is about 35% of our total AUM. We have started to see the result of the scale and liability franchise that we have created. Efficiency has started building out in our network and same has started to reflect in our profitability on quarter-on-quarter basis. Despite demonstrating higher growth and improving profitability, the capital market seems to have not looked at the potential of our platform over the next two to five years. This might be because of our lower market cap, coupled with capital markets have been muted for lending businesses and our differentiated lending model not fully propagated among institutional investors. We have proven our asset engine, its growth potential, our credit engine, and its ability to control credit costs and now our focus for next year will be delivering profitability, which is comparable to any traditional or vintage lender. This, we believe, would put us in the bracket which is superior to banks and traditional NBFC. We have demonstrated that from the last year PBT of INR 20 crores, this year at nine months itself, we have reached INR 50 crores. But now we will focus on doubling the bottom line over next financial year, while asset engine would continue to grow. It takes a lifetime to build financial institutions. We are toddlers vis-a-vis some of the other institutions in our industry. But with a deep sense of responsibility, we say that we are committed to build India's largest small business financing platform, serving the need of the customer, who otherwise do not get access to credit. And in that journey, we would build a financial profile with consistency, which only few have ever achieved. Thank you for listening to us. We are here to answer any question which you may have. Thank you.\n",

      "Moderator: Our first question is from the line of Satish Kumar from Choice Equity Broking.\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (1.0)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Satish Kumar: So my question is about incremental disbursement. So over the last few quarters, we have seen incremental disbursement to the supply chain financing has been increased compared to other prime unsecured and secured segments. So can you throw some light on this, sir?\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (1.0)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Shachindra Nath: Your question is that you are seeing the growth in our disbursement? Or is anything specific.\n",

      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Satish Kumar: Incremental disbursement for supply chain financing segments has been increased over the last few quarters compared to other segments like prime secured and prime unsecured segments?\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (1.0)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Shachindra Nath: Yes. I'll give you headlines thinking about why it is happening and Amit can take you through further. Look, as you would see our last three-year journey, and you look at our distribution model and our risk profiling of our portfolio, we started with prime segment to begin with. We started with eight location prime businesses supported by 500-plus intermediaries and then over a period of time, we implemented multiple other channels. So then within our branch infrastructure, we opened roughly around 75-plus micro enterprises branches. Each of these branch take roughly around 18 months to get to a level of breakeven and then they start throwing assets from that point onwards. We then establish our ecosystem channel, which is the machinery financing and supply financing, our partnership analysis channel and digital, which will go live soon. So it is the evolution and very heavily investing into multiple distribution channels, and they are now matured and - that's why the benefit is coming now. As time passes, each of our channel would grow. And also, you would see the yield profile of the company improving because most of our channels are secured and higher-yielding segment. And also now, we have established our data analytics and GRO Score far more because we have a track record of almost now three years to 3.5 years. So that is also helping us to grow all of our channels. Amit, if you want to add something?\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (0.992)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Amit Mande: So, Mr. Satish, thank you for the question and thank you, Shachin. While you've covered that all our channels are now really coming up the curve and really being able to service all kinds of needs, supply chain is a very peculiar channel that we want to focus on because that really services the short-term need and typically in these seasons, which are festive seasons, one would see that the supply chain demand is extremely high. We've been servicing this demand over last quarter and this quarter again. And so the disbursement in this channel has seen significant growth. However, this will also remain our key channel to service multiple focus sectors, like green energy, like wash, like healthcare, and we will continue to focus on this channel and in future as well, this will remain a significant contribution of our disbursements.\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (0.996)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Satish Kumar: And, sir, my next question is about the operating expenses. So the cost-to-income ratio is around over 60%. and it's a meagre share of our income. So when should we expect this to normalize going forward, sir?\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (0.912)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Shachindra Nath: So, sir, the way I think so, we have expected capital market to be cognizance of the fact that you are seeing a company with a three year vintage, started at ground zero. When we raised our capital, we had not a single person in the company, nor a single loan. Most of the time, what you are seeing in listed world is companies which operate as unlisted for at least five years, seven years, 10 years and get to a level of maturity and then come to the market. And that's why you pay them an X amount of premium. So we have established our business right from day one in the opening glare of a listed market and invested very heavily in the opex. So these our numbers are not comparable to most of the our peer set, but obviously, you don't have to worry too much about it because you have choices to make, as when you board an aircraft, the pilot says that you have many airlines to go on. So you'll choose what provides you the best. But you also think in terms of what would take you to your destination with safety, vis-a-vis many of our peers, which actually, in the initial first five years, bleed on the bottom line. So they burn capital and then come to a breakeven point and operating profit. We have been profitable from day one. And also, we are competing head on to come to a cost- to-income ratio, a return on asset and return on equity, which is equal to or better than most of our peer market. Our year beginning cost-to-income ratio was 72%. It is now at 60%. So all of our opex is now more or less complete. And what you are seeing is only the growth on the asset side. So with every passing quarter, this would continue to improve. I have said in my opening remarks that from a INR 20 crores of bottom line, we have now delivered INR 50 crores of PBT in the first nine months and our endeavour would be to double it for the next year. I did say, if you look at our quarterly presentation, we have said that, in 2025, we'll be at cost-to-income ratio of roughly around 45%, which is the best in the market.\n",

      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (1.0)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Sheetal Gawde: So congratulations, sir, for great sets of number, finally you achieved INR 5,000 crores of AUM milestone and we are sure that by '25, you can easily achieve INR 20,000 crores in your milestone. So I have some couple of questions on the yield side. As you are focusing on the off- balance sheet portfolio, around 50% by FY '24. So currently, the yield on portfolio, which is a total of on-book and off-book is around 17.4 percentage. So I just wanted to know because the liability side is diversified, so that is the reason you can sustain your cost of borrowing. But I just wanted to know on the yield side, how is your view on a future that if you're focusing on the off-book, which is obviously it's a high-yield business, so going forward, how you're looking on the yield side on portfolio side?\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (0.94)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Shachindra Nath: Sir, sorry, off-book to on-book, yield on portfolio has no difference, right? So when your yield of portfolio is at what rate we lend to the customer, right? That is independent of when we are lending to the customer. Whether the asset is going in my balance sheet or is it going to a co- originating partner or it is going to a co-lending partner, yield on the portfolio is yield on the portfolio, right.\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (1.0)\n",

      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (1.0)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Shachindra Nath: So as I was answering the question from Choice Broking, that our prime business which is technically a lower-yielding business is now, in terms of the percentage terms, it is roughly around 50% of our monthly volumes. But our higher-yielding business, micro enterprises, the machinery business and few others, are now gradually growing. So we expect and we are not making a prediction, I said that we will endeavour to double our profitability, and that's a combination of opex remaining flat, credit cost remaining same, stable and flat and our portfolio yield gradually going up and AUM growing up to double the profitability. So I think so it's very difficult sitting here to predict in percentage term what would be the yield increase on the portfolio. But definitely, there'll be an inching up which will happen now.\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (0.999)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Sheetal Gawde: Great. And the second question is on NPA side. So now obviously it's a only two, three years of operations of U GRO. So currently, it's like very nominal GNPA and NNPA. So now the company is focusing on the AUM growth part. Because the narrative of AUM is the secure, right? So how going forward you are expecting that the NNPA will be by '25?\n",

      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (1.0)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Anuj Pandey: So the overall portfolio quality is a function of the overall portfolio mix as well as in individual business lines, what is the expected GNPA. So with our statistical scoring models now quite stable, we are in a position to somewhat predict of how the portfolio will behave. As you would and we have been reiterating this in previous calls as well, the endeavour is to have a healthy balance in the portfolio with secured book overall to be around 70% and unsecured book to be around 30%. And the projected, if you see our five-year plan, the projected gross NPAs are not likely to be over 2%. And the way things are, and we have seen the early warning signals and early indicators of the portfolio, we think we would remain within that.\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (0.997)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Sheetal Gawde: And last one is on the capital raise. Like in the last three years, you raised around 30 billion through equities and debt. So going forward, because now that U GRO is focusing on off-book AUM, so now is there any plan in one year down the line for any capital raise?\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (1.0)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Shachindra Nath: So we have already disclosed at the beginning of the year itself that by end of the quarter, which is the fourth quarter of this year or the first quarter of next financial year, we would be doing the capital raise. Its form, shape and size is not yet defined. But at the speed, at the growth rate which we are, we would definitely be raising capital.\n",

      "Moderator: We'll take our next question from the line of Ankur Kumar from Alpha Capital.\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (1.0)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Ankur Kumar: Congrats for a good set of numbers. Sir, you talked about safety and in the line of that aeroplane. So I just wanted to ask because we have grown to INR 5,000 crores in about 3.5 to four years, and we have good targets for coming two years also. So, but this fast-growing is generally considered not so safe in the financial institutions as in from the capital markets' perspective. So how do you think we are going to manage in terms of both growth as well as managing the NPAs?\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (1.0)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Shachindra Nath: So the answer to this is that, sir, if you look at -- if you compare us with 10 other NBFCs, which are in micro enterprises segment, there is not a single one which started with a total capital at the day one of INR 950-odd crores. So we have recently seen Five Star going IPO. Five Star to reach at the scale where they are, have taken 15 years, but it is not because the wider the capacity was a problem or the market opportunity was a problem or speed was a problem. It is because they started with only INR 25 crores of capital. And to get to the base of capital where we are, it takes roughly around ten years. So the fast growth is not a function because we are disbursing money recklessly. So right from our day one, the log-in to disbursement rate for U GRO has been stable at 30%. For a INR 400 crores worths of loan, we originate INR 1,600 crores every month. It is a function of the capacity which we built first three years, and that is what is affecting the volume, and that's what's maintaining the credit quality. So this business in at the end of 2020 had only 150 people, eight locations. At the end of 2022, it had roughly around 1,500 people, 100 locations, 150 people in technology, 40-plus people in data analytics. So our growth and we are not chasing growth, actually, our installed capacity versus what we are delivering, we already have a gap of 30%, 40%. So we are not chasing growth, growth is coming because all our verticals have been deeply established with both people, technology and credit processes. There'll be definitely a point of inflection after which the company would grow at 15%, 20% per annum basis. But till that time, the base effect of our infrastructure will deliver the growth.\n",

      "Kishore Lodha: So it is largely because of two factors. One is that since we are into MAT, we are still into the old regime, so which is higher compared to the normal tax rate. And also during the merger of Asia Pragati, we have inherited some carry forward losses, where we have created deferred tax assets, some of which has got lapsed during the period, and hence, we had to reverse those losses. So in H1FY23, we have taken a hit of around INR 7.2 crores. And we have incrementally made provision of around INR 4 crores during this quarter. So cumulatively, in YTD December, we have made additional provision of around INR 11.3 crores on deferred tax asset which was created earlier and now require reversal. Otherwise, we would have been in normal stable regime of 30%, which is in line with the old regime of taxation. We are into MAT, hence, we have not migrated into the new tax regime.\n",

      "Kishore Lodha: So deferred tax asset is pending in the books is roughly around INR 17 crores which is available for over next two to three years and one would be available till next 7th years. Part of it, we should be able to utilize. But a part may again, we may have to take a reversal in coming quarters.\n",

      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (0.85)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Shachindra Nath: So we operate in the customer segment in the loan ranges of INR 10 lakh to maximum INR 3 crores, unsecured loan only maximum of INR 25 lakh segment. Generally, all of this noise of about inflation, economic slowdown, Ukraine War and all of that, we believe that, to a very large extent, the micro enterprises segment is [technical glitch] and micro-economies. And also, we are not seeing a major economic slowdown to happen in India which can cast it to the bottom of the pyramid. So generally, from the customer segment in which we operate, we are seeing very healthy growth for all our segments of the market. Having said that, as in financial institution and as a lending institution, this increased rate scenario is obviously of a concern because if our borrowing rate consistently keep increasing, then obviously, that's a problem because our customer finally cannot afford a very high cost because they have a very limited margin. But good thing or good story about it is that we are now seeing the rate hike to taper down, and we are only hoping that only one or two hikes to happen more. Second, I think so that generally, the liquidity in the banking system has reduced because the credit demand has been extremely high. And obviously, as you know, we are largely dependent upon banks and also the capital market, public market, DFIs. But we are not growing by INR 25,000 crores a year. Our growth rate and number of satisfied lender, we think that is also not a big challenge, but that's also continuing to be a risk for the broader market.\n",

      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Shachindra Nath: So as I said, that there are multiple reasons and very difficult to specify. But first and foremost reason that we emerged just prior to ILFS crisis and capital market has seen multiple financial institutions to be under trouble, DHFL, Yes Bank, so on so forth. Then capital markets saw a massive wave of COVID, which affected the lenders generally. So I think so those elements itself, while there was a broader rally in all other sectors, banking and NBFCs had not seen a rally. Now we are seeing little bit of a rally happening only for top- Tier private sector banks, but there are also many number of banks and NBFCs, which are what we call the traditional and legacy, which are also available to public market at a very reasonable price. I think so, look at it this way, if we would have done an IPO now or two years down the line, you guys would have paid a value which would be 4, 5x higher than what we are today. But we are okay with that. But eventually, our moderning superiority on a lower capital base, being an entity, which is being able to generate much higher ROE would get appreciated. So no businesses, which are superior to their peer set can remain out of mainline radar for a very long period of time.

      "Shachindra Nath: No, sir. I think so that -- I think we are in the domain of FinTech and FinTech credit platform are yet to be listed. Paytm was the last and BankBazaar was the last FinTech which got listed, but both of them were non-credit businesses. And both of them went to the market on metrics of listing which are at least I don't understand. So if you look at our asset profile and our business profile, we don't have a direct peer set. So our prime business compete with the bank, our microenterprise business compete with Five Star, Vistaar, Veritas, our supply chain finance business see a compete with global FinTechs, which are in supply chain, our machinery business compete with Electronica and others, our P&A business is similar to that would be a Max Financial, which is a listed. And when we launch our digital channels, that's will be a completely FinTech platform. So I think so, we are creating a category of India's largest small business financing platform driven by data and tech. So we hope that others would also follow. It is very difficult to say this is our listed nearest peer. But only from a valuation perspective, while we are big, broad, diversified, so it's monoline business or where they are, so obviously investors have to make their choice.\n",

So predominantly, we have shortlisted around 8 to 9 sectors and exposed to those accounts which have a credit history. So are we looking to broaden our sectoral outlook beyond those 9 sectors?\n",

And now we are seeing traction overall and the buoyancy. If you recall, our 8 sectors, 3 are quite service-oriented and 5 are mixed, all towards consumption. We are seeing very good growth in these sectors. And at this point in time, we don't see any reason why we should add. But in case there is some opportunity which comes in where we see a lot of potential, theoretically, we are open, but at this point in time, we would like to focus on these 8 sectors and keep building our expertise.\n",

      "Shachindra Nath: So, sir, any investor, whether it is a private equity player or a public market investor, have the flexibility and freedom to come and go, right? And that is the way we would like it to be. Like in an HDFC or ICICI or large platform, investors come and go, the platform or the institution should stand on its own. Having said that, we started with four private equity investors, of which three of them continue to sit on our Board. And we are still within their investment cycles, and there is a long residual fund life. So we think to that, when they'll be near to their fund life cycle, they'll gradually divest, but that is not happening today. So let me add this. As you know sometimes, I've seen sell-side analysts asking this question that what would happen when these large investors would sell. See I've taken the case, example of, say, AU or few other large NBFCs, institutional ownership through private equity is very common now. But normally, these ownership don't come into the public market. So there are larger financial institutions, which would like to come and take over some of these shareholdings. So today we have four Asia private equity funds in our business, but there are then large funds, Sovereign and others, both active and passive. As we continue to grow in size, they like to start or they would like to participate in platform like ours.\n",

      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (0.983)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Kishore Lodha: I‚Äôll take this. Your question is right that while our profit has increased, it is not reflecting into our total equity. Because if you remember, last quarter, we have done a setup in ESOP trust where we have purchased share of worth INR 25 crores, which was adjusted with the capital. Hence, with this adjustment, it is what it is.\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (0.726)\n",

      "Shachindra Nath: In our public disclosure, the ESOP trust approval is for roughly around INR 28-odd crores, of this, INR 25 crores has been exhausted, so rest of it will get exhausted as and when the trust decides, that's an independent offer.

      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (0.999)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Nirvana Laha: So the next question is regarding the deferred tax assets. So Mr. Kishore, you said that INR 17 crores were still left from that demerger. Can you tell us what percentage of the INR 17 crores is likely to lapse again and hit the PBT? Because this number is affecting our ROEs clearly, so a clear guidance on that would help us module things?\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (0.999)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Kishore Lodha: So as we move forward, depending upon the profitability, whether we will be able to absorb it or not will depend upon the what kind of profitability we will have in future. But clearly, we can foresee that, next year, our deferred tax liability, which is about to lapse is close to INR 7 crores. In our belief, with the profitability target, which we have in mind, we should be able to absorb that. So there should not be any impact on PAT next year on this line. And then there is another line, another deferred tax asset, which is there, which is roughly around INR 2.3 crores, which will be lapsing some around 2029, '30 so that much will be unlikely to impact because by that time, our profit will be very high and probably we will be able to absorb it next year or the year after. There is one portion left which is available, which will be lapsing this year itself. A part of the provision we have done in this quarter and the balance portion, if the profitability, we are not able to absorb in next quarter, then this one that part we will be taking in the next quarter.\n",

      "Nirvana Laha: I'll connect offline on that. Secondly, on your projections for FY '25, you have given two ratios this time, which is PBT by average total assets and PAT by average total assets. So if I look at the PAT to PBT ratio there, it's coming to around 18%; 4.5% divided by 5.5%, that's around 82%. So does that mean the normalized tax rate for U GRO going forward is going to be in that 18%, 20% range? Or are you factoring in some deferred tax assets reducing the effective tax rate?\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (0.996)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Kishore Lodha: So it will depend upon two factors. One that as I explained earlier that we are into MAT as of now. So whatever provisioning we are doing, it is on account of deferred tax. So going forward, if the profits are there and we are able to absorb the MAT bracket which is available, depending upon this factor, the final tax rate would arrive at that point of time.\n",

      "Nirvana Laha: I'll connect with you offline on this, Mr. Kishore. I have a few questions on collection efficiency. So the same-month collection efficiency this time is around 94%, and it's consistently at that level. So I was just comparing the collection efficiency with banks. I know Mr. Nath has earlier said that that may not be the right way to look at MSME collection efficiency, but still wanted to just get a confirmation that the 6% that is flowing into buckets, how will this resolve into NPAs? I know that this was explained in the last call, but 6% optically, when I benchmark with banks, which may not be the right benchmark and so I'm asking for this guidance, it looks like it could translate into higher than 1%, 2% NPAs. But if that is not the case for our kind of lending, I would just like you to explain that, please.\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (0.997)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Shachindra Nath: Sure, so I was answering this question that our 94% collection efficiency, what you're comparing with the bank is - ours is 98%, right? So total collection, which is including overdue versus current month demand is the way most of the NBFCs and banks report, that is at 98%. Now Anuj, can you take this 94% and what happens to the 6%? And how but, is that the right way to think that the 6% is all flowing into NPA?\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (0.998)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Anuj Pandey: Yes, I'll take that. Thanks, Shachin. So typically, collection efficiency numbers should be seen in conjunction with the subsequent bucket resolution numbers. So when an account bounces the check for the first time, it moves to what in industry is called Bucket X and the Bucket X resolution rate is the primary driver, along with collection efficiency on what would flow further. Typically, in our case, because it's a small business lending, the Bucket X solution rates are closer to 98%, 99%. And hence, whatever is flowing forward is close to 1% and 1.5% only, which will eventually can become NPA. So a collection efficiency number, along with the Bucket X resolution number, will normally give the full picture.\n",

Today, we have multiple channels and these channels, depending upon the need of the customers, through multiple sources, are originating with customers for their multiple credit needs. There are few things which we focus upon: one, turnaround time; second, meeting the credit demand subject to the credit approval process; and third, post- disbursement experience, which is in terms of timely providing all of what they wanted to do that. That is the count we don't do formal customer satisfaction service. We have done our very large impact study, which is published on our website, and it has also multiple testimonials of what kind of impact we have created for every segment of the market. And if you read through, that would be very interesting insight in terms of very large base of 36,000 customers, what we have been able to achieve. With respect to one aspect of further credit need or, for example, a customer which has taken a loan of machinery, loan against machinery from us, whether we have approached the customer, whether he has come back to us for taking a secure loan, that has not yet started because in terms of our installed capacity versus what we can service, there is always -- there's still a gap.

Those branches, given the size at which they operate and little higher ticket size with lower yield, most of them are broken very quickly. So, except, I think so, five or six, which would be recent addition in this year, most of them are broken even. The micro enterprises, that's much harder business to build because these are Tier 2, Tier 3 towns and you go, these are direct originated business so you have sales, credit, collection, legal, all of that. And then you have to have an origination strategy. You have to also build a brand, because remember, we do secured loans. So if a person who is taking a INR 10 lakh of loan, but giving the papers of a INR 20 lakh worth of his property which is his only property, right? So there is the brand establishment and recogntition has to happen. There, we have roughly around 35-plus branches out of the pool of 71. And that's what I was saying that with every passing quarter, you will have a block of 15, 20 branches who now would keep breaking even and then they will have a positive cash flow coming to the company.

      "Anuj Pandey: Yes. So if you recall, our GRO Score classifies the customer by risk band from A to E. And what we do continuously on quarter-on-quarter is to look at the performance, not only of our own customers, but the customers whom we have scored but not disbursed, on how they are performing on other loans which they have taken from other finances. And so far, we find that the risk classification is stacking up quite decently, so no surprises. Although the data is still for the kind of comprehensive work which we have done, we would like to wait a little more two, three quarters more to see in case there is something else which comes in. But all the early indicators are indicating that the hypothesis of that GRO Score classification will stand good.\n",

Our disbursements are a function of our capacity, which we have built over last18 quarters, actually, right? So I don't think so that there is any decrease in our portfolio yield which will happen. In fact, we are now working, as we see the higher yielding portfolio, microenterprises, machinery business and few others, we think that there will be few basis at least some increase which will happen on the yield. So I said this, that our opex to income ratio or our bottom line would increase by virtue of seeking portfolio and the size of the business growing a little bit of increase in our yields and opex remaining flat and in spite of probably borrowing cost going a little higher, we still think so that our profitability would keep going up from where we are.\n",

So there is a slide which explains the business model of Lending-as-a-Service where you have explained the RoAs and the RoEs, which will be far higher than normal on-balance sheet model. I do understand that you are already having certain off-book kind of a model which you're doing it. What could be the journey from the current level, probably, to a co-lending model where we will see the RoAs and the RoEs expanding meaningfully? At what scale or what are the milestones as investors we should track? If you can just help us explain, that will be really helpful.\n",

      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Shachindra Nath: So I think so that also we have given in our presentation, we have been giving it for a quite a bit of period of time. So if I may request you to look at the Slide 20. And our Slide 20, actually in fact, we were thinking of taking off this slide because we sent it, we have already explained it. So in our Slide 20, you'll see that we have said that by FY '25, the return on asset should go up to 4.5% and RoEs would go up to 17%, 18-odd percent. And with that, off-book to on-book at roughly around 50%. Now this is dynamic. When we say an off-book AUM, this off-book AUM have multiple components, the co-lending, the direct assignment, the co-origination, so on so forth. But the broader point is between traditional and high leverage is not possible for non-bank. It's a very difficult task. If that is the constraining factor, then with low leverage to generate high returns, you have to build a semi-marketplace model, which is an off-book model. And we are a market leader, and we'll see how it evolves.\n",

      "Rishi: Congratulations on a good set of numbers. I think a couple of questions that I had have already been answered with regards to what you saw this business as being different from Five Star finance and also on the gestation period of our key investors, who is been with us over four years already. So I think you've answered these questions. I just have one further question on what your official communication on the rating agency would be like. I think there was a recent downgrade on it. And I did read the announcement from U GRO but it would be good to hear from you on this.\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (0.955)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Shachindra Nath: Exactly same thing, sir, which we have written. So we have not minced our words when it comes to what we have disclosed. So in 2019, we were signing a co-lending agreement with the State Bank of India. At that time, we had neither a requirement of any debt normally as that much of asset book and that rating was required to be taken urgently and we went to Acuite and they gave us the rating. And we signed our first co-origination agreement with State Bank of India. We didn't realize at that point of time because at that time, Acuite, which was earlier called SMERA owned by SIDBI, a large number of financial institution. This is also the same period of time where rest of the rating agencies were deeply affected by IL&FS and DHFL crisis. So they were not doing fresh rating of fresh NBFCs, whether it was ICRA, whether it was CARE, or India Rating, all of them were deeply affected by the IL&FS crisis. So when we took Acuite rating, we didn't understand the challenge with a rating agency like Acuite. We have been raising this concern for a very long period of time in Acuite that market acceptance of Acuite is very poor. To an extent, a large private sector bank on whose Board, there is the Chairman of Acuite is there, but still that large private sector bank don't accept Acuite rating. So having and also there is this market benchmarking, if you are used to be rated by Brickwork, Infomerics and Acuite, other rating agencies rate you one or two notch lower than those rating agencies because these Acuite and likes of rating agencies are not considered in terms of quality at par with the other rating agencies. Acuite actually, in order to continue holding on to our business, upgraded us. First, they made us stable outlook, then they upgraded us, I think so, in August from A to A Plus. But in spite of that, we decided that we have to transition rate into larger rating agency and went ahead and took CRISIL as the rating agency. CRISIL, in all their judgement, rated us A-, which was two notch below what Acuite had rated us. Now that is not in our control. But I think so Acuite came under severe pressure because, as you know, regulators nowadays look at it very seriously and each of the rating agency has to go and explain why their rating is too different from the other rating. And that's why when that happened, they had raised this concern that why we had gone and accepted CRISIL at a two notch below. We told them that, look, we can't survive without with the size and scale of our operations, we cannot survive, and that's why we have taken other rating agency. And in order to self-justify themselves for a very flimsy ground which actually, if you read our letter, all of their grounds are infructuous, as in, they have no meaning, they decided to bring it down from A Plus to A. We are transitioning Acutie out. None of our lenders, both the term lenders or any other lender have raised a single point of concern with their rating downgrade. Hopefully, this is very clear.\n",

      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Shachindra Nath: I think so, sir, look actually, the opportunity set for that is much larger and much wider because our self-origination channel, we technically stop at that yield band of for a customer band or a risk band of what we call the 18% to 19%. There is a large set of customer population which will starts at 18%, 19% band and go all the way to 30%, 35% band. We don't do that on our own. But obviously, there are large number of credible platforms. It can be a FinTech, it can be any small NBFC, it can be a revenue-based financing or any form of innovator, which is backed by good capital and have ability to absorb losses and is willing to work with us. So actually, the number of partnerships has our integration has gone to almost 79. However, we have been holding on to not growing that book quite rapidly. So on an average, we are doing INR 50 crores a month. And we have been diversifying the base of our partners. We are evaluating and seeing that, should we increase this, given that now we have two years of experience, we understand each partners and there we have seen their vintage. So we right in the beginning of the next financial year, we'll take that call that whether we maintain this at the same rate where we are or we accelerate it, given the number of partners have grown.\n",

I was wondering as to how do you see this, given that U GRO is not really in Tier 4, Tier 5, Tier 6? I don't even know what Tier 6 is, to be honest, but what is, according to you, a good geographical as a speak for U GRO? How deep would you penetrate in the future?\n",

      "Shachindra Nath: So I would refrain from commenting on what other players talk about their business and what their moat is, that is for the market to judge. I think so we have at the beginning of our micro enterprises channel, we think that the real credit need is in for the micro enterprises: the micro enterprises, which exists in Tier 2 and Tier 3 towns. And as you rightly said, I don't understand what is the Tier 6 town, from my experience, coming from a very small town, city, that is largely a tehsil or a taluka, very difficult for that to have a business franchise, where you can go and do too much of credit. But Tier 2, Tier 3 town are good enough. And as per our last evaluation, we looked at the entire India and our analysis tells us that the five or seven states from a creditability perspective are the best states and roughly around 350 pin code location where the cluster behaviour of the credit is very good. So we would like to go in those five to seven states and in those 350 to 400-plus cluster locations.\n",

      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (1.0)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Nirvana Laha: Mr. Nath, my question is on the Lending-as-a-Service slide. So I see that earlier we used to have six banks and six NBFCs as partners. This quarter, it has come down to four NBFC. And we used to show a pipeline of potential deals, that I don't see this quarter. So my question is, to reach our INR 10,000 crores off-book target for FY '25, how are we placed in terms of these existing ten partners? And how much do we need to depend on forging new partnerships?\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (0.997)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Shachindra Nath: So, sir, why it has come down, because we have learned the art of saying no. Because once you started with your though that actually we are a small company, we are a young company, and anyone who is showing interest, we should do all efforts and just go and sign up. We realized that in marriages, it is not just important for bride and groom to come together and tie the knot, they have to live together also and living together had different connotation. Even if you have been a boyfriend, if you have been partners and know each other for a long period of time, once you start living in the same room, it's a different story altogether. So in view of that, certain NBFC which we signed up, but we don't think so that philosophically, our philosophies match. So we have suspended those partnerships very amicably, and we'll go back to them. In terms of why the new lines are not there, because the existing capacity we are not being able to service. The top three banks, public sector banks in India, the number which you are quoting up to 2025, 75% of that actually is among the first three banks which we have signed up, right? And we have not been able to deliver that at all. So that's why we were under so much of pressure from existing large banks, each one of them having expectation that we will deliver INR 100 crores per month, we thought that we should limit our relationship right now and expand only next year, when so one bank has now reached up to, I think so, INR 700-odd crores, other banks has reached around INR 200-odd crores. So I think so, INR 1,000 crores to INR 1,500 crores, wherein a large bank would pause and review us and then give us another INR 1,000 crores of line. So I think so, we have more than sufficient partnership which exists today. And at our choice, we can increase it whenever we want.\n",

      "Kishore Lodha: Good afternoon, everyone. This is Kishore Lodha, CFO of the company. I on behalf of the UGRO Capital welcome you on the call. Unfortunately, Mr. Nath is not here because of some personal commitments. We have shared the presentation yesterday and hope you have gone through the same. Along with me our Chief Risk Officer Mr. Anuj Pandey is there, our Chief Revenue Officer Mr. Amit Mande is there, our Chief Strategy Officer Mr. Nirav Shah is there, and we will be covering the entire portion of the results in the respective areas. As far as this quarter is concerned, the growth momentum continues. Over the previous quarter, quarter-on-quarter growth on AUM has been 20%. We have closed the quarter with 4,375 crore AUM which is 126% over the same period last year. We recorded highest disbursement during this quarter, which stood at 1,653 crores, 110% growth over year-on-year. Overall, loan originated during H1 stood at 3,011 crores, vis-√†-vis 1,123 crores in the previous year in the same period. The yield have improved, not only the business has grown significantly during the quarter, the yield has also gone up from 16.7% to 17.2%. That is an increase by two factor One is the that the main story is changing little bit where we are going for the high yield portfolio as well as due to increase in the market interest rate, we have also increased our lending rate to our customers. Total net income has increased by 87 crores, 24% higher compared to the previous quarter. Opex ratio continues to improve where while in the last quarter it was close to 73% and now it has come down to 62%. On PBT, we have closed the quarter at 17.6-crore whereas last quarter, we closed around 10 crores, so there is almost 70% growth quarter-on- quarter as far as PPT is concerned; however, the PAT has gone down from 7 crore to 5 crore, and it is largely because of we have taken the reversal of deferred tax asset of 7.19 crore during the quarter. So had that not been there, the PAT would have been 70% higher compared to the previous quarter. During the quarter, we have added six more lender in our lending books so now there are more than 65 lenders, which is quite diverse so almost every lender you can name is there in our boring book now. Some of the impact funds we have added during the quarter, some of the large NBFCS and banks we have added during the quarter. Overall though the aggressive scenario is looking difficult. Overall, repo rate have gone up from 4% to 5.9% in the market but our rates have gone up by only 20 basis points during the first half. It is because of the efficiency that we are raking in and with the seasoning, with the lenders that is coming in. Our rates are remaining more-or-less flat-ish during the quarter. So, as we discussed in our earlier calls that we will be doing more of co-lending, increasing our exposure in co-lending and co-origination book and we have continued with that strategy where co-origination book has increased from 21% to 29% and our endeavor would be take it up to 35% till March 2023, which will land to the ROAs and ROEs as we have deliberated in our earlier discussions. Now I will hand over to our colleague, Mr. Anuj Pandey to talk about the asset qualities and the collection for the quarter and for the half year ended 30th September. we call Gro Score 2.0 which is a statistical based underwriting template, which has been developed inhouse and the idea was to look at the chosen sectors of ours which are nine of them and develop models for customers basis their banking behavior and repayment behavior. We have been using this since our inception. We are currently on the version 2 of that score. When we started, we were only using the repayment-based scoring and we have seen tremendous efficiencies because of that both in terms of very predictable portfolio performance and giving a very good turnaround time as far as underwriting decisions are concerned. So, our approach on a scientific templated underwriting model is well underway and we are quite happy with the progress. In fact, now we are upgrading our Gro Score template to the version 3 where the plan is to also include the GST data in using and predicting the repayment behavior and in future, we would like to forecast the cash flows by customer for each of the sectors which you have chosen and also get some estimates on the eligibility itself from this. So overall from the robustness and from the results of scorecard perspective, we are quite happy with the progress. Now coming to the portfolio performance, the gross NPA at the end of September 30th is a little less than 1.7%, quite stable. We were at 1.7% in previous quarter as well. The net NPA stands at around 1.2%. Our overall approach on the portfolio mix has been quite clear from the start. We would like approximately 70% of the portfolio to always be secured either by collateral or by some kind of trade enhancement, so we continue to do that. The portfolio at the end of September 30th is also in the same ratio 70:30. Some of investors and analysts keep asking us about the portfolio performance in the light of less seasoning of the book and I would like to touch upon this topic, and this is something which we closely monitor. The approach which we have adopted because the true tests actually will come post the portfolio gets seasoned for a few more years but now with the scientific tools available to us, we keep tracking the early portfolio indicators. Also, if you recall, when we had started our focus was to garner more of secured assets at a relatively lower yields, which historically have proven and given lower NPAs. So, the philosophy is to build up slowly, to lend to customers who have very good repayment track record we don't lend to new to credit and keep tracking the early portfolio indicators. So far, we have seen that all of them are tracking quite well. We also every quarter do a proof of concept of our Gro Score and in that we widened the neck, and we keep also assessing the customers who were scored by us but were not given a loan for variety of other reasons but we keep tracking their portfolio performance for their repayment behavior in other loans and we find that indeed the risk ranking which is coming out of our internal Gro Score is stacking up. On the collection efficiencies front, the collection efficiencies on overall portfolio level remains stable. They are at around 94% and this has been the number for last two-three quarters. In fact, our estimates are that they will steadily improve with overall Improvement in the macro economy. On the bounce rate fronts also we have seen a steady decline in bounce rates now at an overall portfolio level, they are at around 17%. A little bit on the restructured book in the portfolio when we started at the end of pandemic 2 the total restructured book was around 7% of the portfolio, now it has got reduced to 2.6%. So, in absolute terms about 113 crores of the portfolio which was restructured is on books, about 95% of those restructured customers, the repayment period has started and now we have a very good fix and hand on how the portfolio under restructuring is behaving and we are quite happy with that progress as well. In terms of overall provisioning, our provision coverage ratio for stage 3 has improved by more than 200 basis points and now it is around 30%. Our overall stage one contribution has seen a lot of improvement and it has gone up now to 96.4% from 94.6% in last quarter. So, on an average and on whole this has been quite a\n",

      "Amit Mande: So, a quick in fact wrap up of whatever Kishore and Anuj spoke. Kishore spoke about our achievements on disbursements and AUM, Anuj first spoke on the hold of portfolio. I would like to only add a couple of points in fact wanted to add that we have now made strong inroads in every type of distribution, which essentially means there are strong inroads in the intermediary leg, the direct distribution, the ecosystem the distribution and the Fintech and digital origination. What is important to note is that all our production and our underwriting framework is now acceptable in all the banks on the co-lending piece which means now we have the confidence to sweat out our infrastructure and people to build that we've built over the last two years. What we are very excited about is that we've built a very robust distribution with a granular portfolio and the average ticket size keeps going down from the current 16.5 lakh rupees. The mix of the unsecured and secured remains also very healthy as Anuj spoke. So, we will continue to build efficiencies to fuel our growth trajectory on the disbursements on the AUM to touch the 7000 crore AUM by end of this financial year and across all parameters as the guidance that is provided in our presentation, so having said that Nirav you want to do the closing comment. Nirav Shah. Thanks Amit. So, most of it has been covered by my dear colleagues Kishore, Anuj and Amit. What is important for you know all of us is to note that we were very bold in terms of releasing what we will achieve in FY-23 going towards FY-25. When we did that a lot of questions had come to us saying it is it is too futuristic number for you guys to kind of deliver and you know you lot of the sell side and buy side will actually time and say that you know you have not been able to achieve or try and compare yourself with your achievements. You know we were actually very bold at that time but what we are now doing is we have spent the very good amount of time ensuring that each of the line items when it comes to yields, when it comes to interest costs, when it comes to employee expenses etc. we are tracking it you know very granularly on a month-on-month basis and we believe now that what we have set out we are there to achieve it. I think that is the only thing I wanted to convey to the to the community that yes, it is difficult for us to kind of achieve the bold numbers that we have given out, but I think we are very well on track to achieve those numbers. I think with that I will hand it over to Kaitav and Kaitav may want to open the floor for questions.\n",

      "Anil Tulsiram: Yeah, thanks for taking my question. This is Anil Tulsiram from Contrarian Value Edge. My first question is on the capital raise, so I want to understand how important it's for you to raise the funds in the next 12 to 18 months and in the unfortunate case that you're not able to raise the funds then what is the maximum leverage credit trading agencies and lenders will allow us?\n",

      "Nirav Shah: Sure, so we had during a last call we had given a guidance that we would be doing an equity fundraising process and you know by end of this financial year and that process is something that is timeframe and still be able to achieve the same numbers. With respect to your question on the leverage, we have always believed that we would cap our leverage at four times debt-to-equity ratio and there is still a long way you know from the current 2.85x leverage that we have at this point in time.\n",

      "Anil Tulsiram: There are many microfinance companies which give the guidance that they are comfortable with five times leverage being unsecured they are comfortable with five times and their credit rating agencies are comfortable then why do we want to restrict ourselves to only four times means what is the rationale behind it.\n",

      "Nirav Shah: So, I think Anil there is no real as such rational, I think we just wanted to make sure that we are able to weather any kind of a storm that you know comes in future. So, by restricting us there is no hard coded 4x debt-to-equity ratio that you know we are saying. What we are saying is that once we achieved that or we approach to that number then we should be looking at other avenues of fundraising, it could be equity as Kishore said it could be Tier-2 debt etc. etc. While with our vintage we are pretty much sure that we can still reach five to five and half times debt to equity ratio but just to be within our limits and to have a very clear visibility, we are saying we will preferably not want to go beyond 4x at this point in time. That also leaves something what we call as is a confidence capital on table for the other large debt you know participants like Public Sector Banks etc. who would become very comfortable when it is sub 4x leverage.\n",

      "Anil Tulsiram: Okay. Sir, and my next question is on the account aggregator. I think it is going to get implemented from the early next year and once it gets implemented, what they are trying to do with the growth rate that any bank will be able to do it means collecting the account statements and the GST data, so in what way it will be difficult for them to replicate what we are doing or means how the underwriting is much more beyond just this bank statement and GST that is what basically I want to understand?\n",

      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Anuj Pandey: I will pick it up. In fact, account aggregation and the account aggregated model is already live and there are about 10 banks which are already live and what it does is basically on one consent of the customer it allows the financier to fetch all its bank accounts. Eventually, all its financial assets will get added in this network, that is the broad plan. Now to your question of whether this will truly democratize the banking data and hence how we are different if I understood you correctly to tell you the banking data is still available to all including the banks themselves. The point is whether you are able to apply them in a smart way in a statistical model to your chosen target segment that is where a proprietary work and insight-based work comes upon. Now today our underwriting is primarily based on GST, banking and repayment. Now these are things which are available to all for last five years, but still basis the application of a machine learning algorithm on our chosen target segment we have been evolving the underwriting model and that is something which takes time and hence whosoever chooses to do that of course can do\n",

      "Kaitav Shah: Thank you Anil. I think Mr. Wayne D‚Äômello can go next. Wayne D‚ÄôMello: Hi! Yes, so congrats on good set of numbers. My first question was on the co-lending side specifically on you know our GRO-extreme platform. So, we have you know a partners fintech NBFCs that we've partnered with who also have their own platforms, like you have lending cart which has that together platform, you have Yubi with co-lend platform. So, my question on GRO-Extreme is you've said that you want to grow it to be the biggest platform for co-lending in India where you know even the smallest of the NBFCs can get in touch with the largest of banks. So, my question is one what do you see as the USP of our platform when compared to the other platforms that exist and what are your goals you know how do you see the progress and what's the timeline on that, that is the first question?\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (0.986)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Anuj Pandey: Okay, so, overall, the difference is in the concept because we are a large lender ourselves so when a balance sheet provider makes a platform which can be integrated with other lenders and other partners are then the Insight which it brings for example, we have a proprietary GRO score which is already developed and now is getting proved quarter-on-quarter on our chosen MSME segment. Now if someone, if a partner wants to use that for their data that would be available to us but our approach has always been complementing and not competing so for example we are integrating with the Yubi‚Äôs of the world and other such platforms are typically what happens is in a PSU Bank especially on one or it is very difficult for them to integrate with many platforms and it might so happen that one of these platforms get integrated first. Our approach has been to either integrate directly or integrate via these platforms so that overall, we are able to serve the needs of the ecosystem Wayne D‚ÄôMello: Okay, that makes sense.\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (0.996)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Amit Mande: One more thing on that is GRO score being, so one more thing is the ability on the smaller NBFCs model, your smaller NBFCs also the larger banks and the NBFCs to use the proprietary GRO score which is the real value add so, one is the platform; two is the intellectual property value and of the GRO score for each of these partners to access and evaluate the portfolio; and third of course is the ability to be a lender to the smaller NBFCs. So, it is little different than with a platform like a Yubi which is only a platform that connects multiple partners. Wayne D‚ÄôMello: Yeah, understood, thanks for the reply. So, yeah on co-lending again by 2025 we've guided for you know 50% of our book to be off book off that I think you said around 20-23% will be through co-lending, right? Wayne D‚ÄôMello: Yeah. So, what are your thoughts on you know increasing that percentage because it's obviously better for us on the ROEs and on those metrics and we have peers that are already you know doing up to 90% off book. So, do you have any thoughts on, are you flexible with taking it up from the 50% that you've guided for?\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (0.747)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Amit Mande: So, at this point of time the guidance is 50% and there is an opportunity to further increase it to higher percentages. There are two things that we are currently look at it. (A just being a platform has to be acceptable because then we are just 10%, we are just a platform and so whether the people whom we are co-lending with they don't find skin in the game and so that acceptance has to yet be proved. So, the opportunity still rests but we don't just want to be a passive platform and a lender, we want to know how our skin in the games are. At this point of time, we exercise 50 if the opportunity permits, we could further take it up as we as time goes by. At the current point in time, we anyways on month-on-month are of booking 50% of our disbursement you would have seen our off-book AUM now at 29% of the total AUM, which has moved from 21% in the last quarter. So. it's moving very rapidly, so like you said there is opportunity, but we would like to keep skin in the game, you would like to give that confidence to our co- lenders and so 50% is what we believe is the right number to reach by 2025. Wane D‚ÄôMello: Okay, thank you. And one last question is just for the sake of investors like how do you guys define collection efficiency so we are at 94%. So, you know what comprises the rest of the 6%?\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (0.675)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Anuj Pandey: So, we define connection efficiency by current collection divided by current demand. Typically, in other Financial Services Industry a lot of people give collection efficiency by dividing the total collection by current due, if we do that, our connection efficiency would be closer to 99%. So, this rest 6% is what flows into what we call buckets. The first bucket is called bucket X, typically in that bucket X our resolution rates are around 97-98%.

In which regions are we focused primarily is it larger cities or the Tier 2 and 3 markets. Over to management.\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (1.0)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Anuj Pandey: So, we have two distinct branch led channels; one is what we call Prime Channels which is now in the top 25 locations spread across nine states and these typically are locations where the concentration of our targeted sectors is higher. For our micro enterprises distribution, we had chosen five states to invest in. So, today we have about 75 branches in Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Karnataka, Rajasthan and Gujarat. We chose these five states basis a thorough statistical analysis by PIN codes across the country for our kind of ticket sizes, the health of micro enterprises and the portfolio performance and we found that these five states were cut above the rest so our district solution strategy in micro going forward also would be focused on these five states. in the lab space and small ticket size loans are we seeing the competition shaping in?\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (1.0)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Amit Mande: So, two ways to look at it. One, the competition has always been there. The MSME segment has always been a hot segment where the banks always wanted to build their portfolios in there, not only the banks or the institutional push but there is a larger strategic approach from the government itself towards the NBFCs. So, the competition is there in that segment. On one side, there is competition, Banks, and liquidity on the other side people talk about the credit Gap that is there in the MSME segment. So, between these two things one would have realized that delivery of credit to the MSME is an extremely difficult subject that people thought it was and large focus has always been on the consumer segment like the personal loans or the vehicle loans, etc. what we've been able to do is really focus by sector and by geographies into the MSME segment so our dedicated and committed Focus has also led us to build a risk model that is unique and can scale up. So, in that sense we have a better risk and underwriting model and that is why our turnaround times to the customers and ability to assess and understand customers is better and so while we appreciate and we really respect the competition that is there in the market, we believe that we have a unique proposition because of which we will stay ahead of the competition. So, whether it is the segment that we are, whether it is the micro enterprises segment, or the machinery finance segment or for that matter the business loan secure and unsecure, our proposition is to work on data and technology and give fast turnaround time versus the customer right and that has helped us, that has been the real driver of our growth in last three quarters.\n",

We started about 75 branches in Q3 and 25 branches in Q1 Q2 and then you reached about 75 branches in Q3 and Q4. The learning curve has been, we always believed that there would be a learning curve and so this year we decided to not expand and see how these branches become profitable so that it really powers our growth going forward. What we've seen is today as we speak from the 75 branches that we have 31 branches that have already broken even, and we will see the entire set of 75 branches breaking even by end of this year which means that the break-even period of between 12 to 15 months that we expected, and the model is working.

So our slippage ratio or credit cost ratio should be close to this number but that's not the case so I know Collection efficiency is not a rolling number as in customer who didn't pay in August, would have paid in September and would have dropped off the bucket but there is this huge gap so and if I see your 30-day past due 30 DPD is around 5-6% and then there is a drop off in the 90 day pass due to 1 ‚Äì 2 %. So, can you explain this client behavior. Are they always you know they pass their due for a few days and then when they get their cash, they pay it back.\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (0.985)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Anuj Pandey: Okay two things, one the understanding of how the flow rates works. So, typically whatever is bounced will move into DPDs or what we call collection buckets. Typically, there are four collection buckets between 0 to 30 days past due 30 to 60, 60 to 90 and 90 and beyond, which basically means whether you have one EMI due, two EMIs due, 3 EMIs due or more EMIs than 3 which are due. For our kind of target segment typically in the first bucket the resolution rates are closer to 95, 96, 97% because this is a function of the nature of the target segment this is an SME, he may not have the money on the due date, but he is fine paying the amount in that calendar month. Then if there is more than one EMI due then typically the resolution rates are between 70 to 80%. If there are more than 2 EMIs dues, the resolution rates will fall obviously, and it is around 50 to 60% and then the case becomes NPA and then the recovery rate depending on the product which is about 20 to 25%. So, when you multiply all of them together you get a number which is called Product of flows that is the number which gives an indication of how much of your current asset is likely to become NPA in the subsequent three months. That number for us is between 0.1 to 0.15% and this is the number we keep tracking regularly. The number which you quoted for 30+ and 90 + I think we're a little different our 30 + number end of September is 3.5%. So, there are 3.5% of the portfolio where the customers have not paid more than one EMI.\n",

      "Sanjay Kumar: So, if you can give the breakthrough of slippages, recoveries and upgrades and if you could give the latest DPD numbers in the PPD that will be helpful. So, second question, so there was increase in the credit cost. So any color on that and for this segment that you have cater to the MSME sector, is 1.5% build cost the right number or is it slightly on the lower side compared to the other banks, because even the banks that are your co-lending partners they have credit cost almost 2% or upwards, so any insights on this credit cost piece and why there was an increase in this?\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (0.593)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Anuj Pandey: Okay, so the credit cost increased primarily because the disbursals increased. So, the way credit costs are done, whatever you have disbursed newly. You assign a provision which used to be called good book provisioning or standard provisioning. So, because our disbursals in this quarter has gone up that's why the credit cost has gone up that typically is about 1% off of the new business generated. As far using our SME GRO score database underwriting in a very different way so our estimates are that it will always be little lower than what our peers are.\n",

      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (0.91)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Amit Mande: So, I will take this question. So, at this point of time whether it is State Bank of India or Central Bank or Bank of Baroda or PSB, the limits allocated are way higher than what we have for co-lend with them today. So at this point of time we do see any reason why we should go back to even change the limits we will come to this question maybe another year down the line or six-eight months down the line having said this some of the banks that we are the largest co-lending partners there our co-lending book with the banks is now upwards of 600 crores and we are seeing more and more demand and more and more push from these public sector banks to co-lenders and so at this point of time we do not have problems with the limits.\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (0.929)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Sanjay Kumar: Okay sir, third on the provision coverage so we are at I think 30% now how comfortable are we with this 30% what has been the recovery that we've been able to do in the recent past and will this number be settled here or do you want to take it higher because even a CV Financial would be at 35- 40%, yeah I think even other secured guys would be at those levels. So, something on this any insights?\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (0.576)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Anuj Pandey: So typically, the provision coverage ratios for stage 3 asset keep going up as the vintage of portfolio keeps going up and it is also should be seen in light of your absolute gross NPAs and net NPS. So, what one wants to balance out is that the uncovered portion of your NPAs should not be very high. So today our net NPA is only about 1.2% and hence at this point of time we are very comfortable with 30% provision coverage ratio but as our portfolio matures, as the book size increases this provision coverage will also keep increasing gradually.\n",

      "Kaitav Shah: Yes, Nikhil you are audible, please introduce yourself and ask your questions. model, so I just wanted to get it clear view on how FLDG works because uh so there was this regulation that Banks and NBFCs cannot do FLDG together. So NBFCs and NBFCs have to do together something like that so if you could give me a clear view on how FLDG works and how we are doing it in the correct way so if you could just explain that and my second question is about credit cost that sir you say that with this disbursals are provisions are going up and although we are comfortable at the 30% level right now with the increase in vintage, assets provision will go up and at the same time it seems that our credit cost will remain under the current levels of 1.5-1.6%. So, is this going to be true because with increasing provisions and the increasing disbursements and AUM targets that we have I think there could be a further increase in credit cost. So can you please explain these two things.\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (0.948)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Anuj Pandey: So, I'll answer the second question first. While we are talking about the provision coverage ratio, we were talking about the provision coverage on stage 3 assets or NPA assets and then we are talking about the total credit cost, we are talking about the total credit cost on the overall book. So, they are two different things, although they are related in an indirect way but should not be seen together the way you have interpreted. The more disbursals we do, the stage 1 provision, which is the book which is correct that will keep going up. As our NPAs go up and the vintage of the NPAs within the stage 3 goes up, the provision coverage will keep increasing for stage 3. So, they both can exist together. Overall, in our calculation and in our annual plans and for the plans up to 2025, we see that overall combined both stage 1, stage 2, and stage 3, the credit cost should remain in the vicinity of 1.5-1.6%. Within this the stage 3 provision coverage ratio will keep going up.\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (0.526)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Nikhil Kumar Agarwal: Sr, just one follow up regarding this. So, I was not confused between the stage 1 provision and the stage 2 provision. I just wanted to know that from the incremental Provisions flowing through P&L major part of it would be for the NPA Provisions because vintage would go up, is that a fair assumption or please correct me if I'm wrong?\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (1.0)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Anuj Pandey: No, so it will be as long as our annual disbursals are contribution in the total AUM is higher in the vicinity of so today for example, we are at an AUM of 4400-crore with about 1300-crore getting disbursed in last quarter itself which basically means that 25 of the total book has been recently sourced. So, this figure will keep going as the portfolio keeps going up, this contribution of freshly sourced portfolio will keep coming down and that will have an impact but having said that the trade cost is also a function of our portfolio construct. We are very clear that 70% of the portfolio will remain secured and 30% can remain unsecured. Now in unsecured when it starts getting delinquent and start moving to stage 3 then the provision coverage on that part increases in an accelerated way. While in secured we have seen that the recoveries happen and hence one is able to pull it back. So, the approach is a twin. One is to keep steady on our portfolio design and also keep having a very close monitoring on the contribution of recently sourced portfolio to the overall portfolio.\n",

Two, between the NBFCs to NBFCs which are both regulated entities FLDG is what we do as well as guided by the securitization compliance as a guidance and so on the asset side all our definitive partnerships and lending partnerships are regulated entities and we have we have our first loss coverage from them in accordance securitization guideline, have I been able to answer the question on what is the difference and with whom are we doing what?\n",

      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (1.0)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Kishor Lodha: So, I will take this question. So, there are two sets of co-lending guidelines called, scheme 1 and scheme 2. Scheme 1, there you do co-lending on a pari passu basis where both the counterparties jointly lend to the customer so if customer is there willing to take 100-rupee loans based on the joint lending program both the parties are funding the ratio of the agreement. So, if the bank is taking 80% and disbursal will happen. Here uh the accounting would be like a normal lending accounting where 20% units recognize by interest and on the 80% where the bank is funding the differential interest if any is there has to be accounted in the books of the originators. In direct assignment where you first originate the customer in your book and then downsize it to the bank or the partner depending upon the co-lending program and the ratios so 80-20 is the most common practice. So, in that case the income is treated like direct assignment where you have to upfront the lifetime income of that particular loan converting into the deferred asset and recognizing your P&L.\n",

      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Amit Mande: So to answer I think first of all want us to understand the spirit of the guideline. The spirit of the guideline says that the lender cannot be a passive lender and so should take active part in the risk assessment and risk management so that's one. Two uh it also talks about regulated and non-regulated entities, or I partially answered this all our partners on the asset side where we do co-lending and co- origination are regulated entities, which means that where the FLDG and that is our opinion FLDG is not applicable to a partnership between a non-regulated and a regulated entity. We do not have such relationships. All our relationships are regulated and so FLDG continues to be a part of the agreement that's one. Two uh because these are all regulated entities all three important or rather four important parameters that are defined in the guidelines one is disbursement into the customer account, two repayments from the customer directly into an escrow or our own account, three the E-customer fact sheet and four the IP audit. All these have been carried out across all partnerships and we are compliant across all relationships so that has not impacted us at all. It is absolutely similar with the banks that we co-lend with and so we do not have any impact on the draft digital lending guidelines.\n",

I am handing over the call now to Mr. Kishore Lodha. Over to you sir.\n",

      "Kishore Lodha: Good afternoon, everyone. This is Kishore Lodha, CFO of the company. I on behalf of the UGRO Capital welcome you on the call. Unfortunately, Mr. Nath is not here because of some personal commitments. We have shared the presentation yesterday and hope you have gone through the same. Along with me our Chief Risk Officer Mr. Anuj Pandey is there, our Chief Revenue Officer Mr. Amit Mande is there, our Chief Strategy Officer Mr. Nirav Shah is there, and we will be covering the entire portion of the results in the respective areas. As far as this quarter is concerned, the growth momentum continues. Over the previous quarter, quarter-on-quarter growth on AUM has been 20%. We have closed the quarter with 4,375 crore AUM which is 126% over the same period last year. We recorded highest disbursement during this quarter, which stood at 1,653 crores, 110% growth over year-on-year. Overall, loan originated during H1 stood at 3,011 crores, vis-√†-vis 1,123 crores in the previous year in the same period. The yield have improved, not only the business has grown significantly during the quarter, the yield has also gone up from 16.7% to 17.2%. That is an increase by two factor One is the that the main story is changing little bit where we are going for the high yield portfolio as well as due to increase in the market interest rate, we have also increased our lending rate to our customers. Total net income has increased by 87 crores, 24% higher compared to the previous quarter. Opex ratio continues to improve where while in the last quarter it was close to 73% and now it has come down to 62%. On PBT, we have closed the quarter at 17.6-crore whereas last quarter, we closed around 10 crores, so there is almost 70% growth quarter-on- quarter as far as PPT is concerned; however, the PAT has gone down from 7 crore to 5 crore, and it is largely because of we have taken the reversal of deferred tax asset of 7.19 crore during the quarter. So had that not been there, the PAT would have been 70% higher compared to the previous quarter. During the quarter, we have added six more lender in our lending books so now there are more than 65 lenders, which is quite diverse so almost every lender you can name is there in our boring book now. Some of the impact funds we have added during the quarter, some of the large NBFCS and banks we have added during the quarter. Overall though the aggressive scenario is looking difficult. Overall, repo rate have gone up from 4% to 5.9% in the market but our rates have gone up by only 20 basis points during the first half. It is because of the efficiency that we are raking in and with the seasoning, with the lenders that is coming in. Our rates are remaining more-or-less flat-ish during the quarter. So, as we discussed in our earlier calls that we will be doing more of co-lending, increasing our exposure in co-lending and co-origination book and we have continued with that strategy where co-origination book has increased from 21% to 29% and our endeavor would be take it up to 35% till March 2023, which will land to the ROAs and ROEs as we have deliberated in our earlier discussions. Now I will hand over to our colleague, Mr. Anuj Pandey to talk about the asset qualities and the collection for the quarter and for the half year ended 30th September.\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (1.0)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Anuj Pandey: Thank you, Kishore. Good evening, everyone before I take you through the asset quality for the first half of the year, I would like to recap our underwriting approach and model. So, we use what we call Gro Score 2.0 which is a statistical based underwriting template, which has been developed inhouse and the idea was to look at the chosen sectors of ours which are nine of them and develop models for customers basis their banking behavior and repayment behavior. We have been using this since our inception. We are currently on the version 2 of that score. When we started, we were only using the repayment-based scoring and we have seen tremendous efficiencies because of that both in terms of very predictable portfolio performance and giving a very good turnaround time as far as underwriting decisions are concerned. So, our approach on a scientific templated underwriting model is well underway and we are quite happy with the progress. In fact, now we are upgrading our Gro Score template to the version 3 where the plan is to also include the GST data in using and predicting the repayment behavior and in future, we would like to forecast the cash flows by customer for each of the sectors which you have chosen and also get some estimates on the eligibility itself from this. So overall from the robustness and from the results of scorecard perspective, we are quite happy with the progress. Now coming to the portfolio performance, the gross NPA at the end of September 30th is a little less than 1.7%, quite stable. We were at 1.7% in previous quarter as well. The net NPA stands at around 1.2%. Our overall approach on the portfolio mix has been quite clear from the start. We would like approximately 70% of the portfolio to always be secured either by collateral or by some kind of trade enhancement, so we continue to do that. The portfolio at the end of September 30th is also in the same ratio 70:30. Some of investors and analysts keep asking us about the portfolio performance in the light of less seasoning of the book and I would like to touch upon this topic, and this is something which we closely monitor. The approach which we have adopted because the true tests actually will come post the portfolio gets seasoned for a few more years but now with the scientific tools available to us, we keep tracking the early portfolio indicators. Also, if you recall, when we had started our focus was to garner more of secured assets at a relatively lower yields, which historically have proven and given lower NPAs. So, the philosophy is to build up slowly, to lend to customers who have very good repayment track record we don't lend to new to credit and keep tracking the early portfolio indicators. So far, we have seen that all of them are tracking quite well. We also every quarter do a proof of concept of our Gro Score and in that we widened the neck, and we keep also assessing the customers who were scored by us but were not given a loan for variety of other reasons but we keep tracking their portfolio performance for their repayment behavior in other loans and we find that indeed the risk ranking which is coming out of our internal Gro Score is stacking up. On the collection efficiencies front, the collection efficiencies on overall portfolio level remains stable. They are at around 94% and this has been the number for last two-three quarters. In fact, our estimates are that they will steadily improve with overall Improvement in the macro economy. On the bounce rate fronts also we have seen a steady decline in bounce rates now at an overall portfolio level, they are at around 70%. A little bit on the restructured book in the portfolio when we started at the end of pandemic 2 the total restructured book was around 7% of the portfolio, now it has got reduced to 2.6%. So, in absolute terms about 113 crores of the portfolio which was restructured is on books, about 95% of those restructured customers, the repayment period has started and now we have a very good fix and hand on how the portfolio under restructuring is behaving and we are quite happy with that progress as well. In terms of overall provisioning, our provision coverage ratio for stage 3 has improved by more than 200 basis points and now it is around 30%. Our overall stage one contribution has seen a lot of improvement and it has gone up now to 96.4% from 94.6% in last quarter. So, on an average and on whole this has been quite a good quarter as far as portfolio performance is concerned. Now I'll hand over to Mr. Amit for his views on business.\n",

      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Amit Mande: So, a quick in fact wrap up of whatever Kishore and Anuj spoke. Kishore spoke about our achievements on disbursements and AUM, Anuj first spoke on the hold of portfolio. I would like to only add a couple of points in fact wanted to add that we have now made strong inroads in every type of distribution, which essentially means there are strong inroads in the intermediary leg, the direct distribution, the ecosystem the distribution and the Fintech and digital origination. What is important to note is that all our production and our underwriting framework is now acceptable in all the banks on the co-lending piece which means now we have the confidence to sweat out our infrastructure and people to build that we've built over the last two years. What we are very excited about is that we've built a very robust distribution with a granular portfolio and the average ticket size keeps going down from the current 16.5 lakh rupees. The mix of the unsecured and secured remains also very healthy as Anuj spoke. So, we will continue to build efficiencies to fuel our growth trajectory on the disbursements on the AUM to touch the 7000 crore AUM by end of this financial year and across all parameters as the guidance that is provided in our presentation, so having said that Nirav you want to do the closing comment. Nirav Shah. Thanks Amit. So, most of it has been covered by my dear colleagues Kishore, Anuj and Amit. What is important for you know all of us is to note that we were very bold in terms of releasing what we will achieve in FY-23 going towards FY-25. When we did that a lot of questions had come to us saying it is it is too futuristic number for you guys to kind of deliver and you know you lot of the sell side and buy side will actually time and say that you know you have not been able to achieve or try and compare yourself with your achievements. You know we were actually very bold at that time but what we are now doing is we have spent the very good amount of time ensuring that each of the line items when it comes to yields, when it comes to interest costs, when it comes to employee expenses etc. we are tracking it you know very granularly on a month-on-month basis and we believe now that what we have set out we are there to achieve it. I think that is the only thing I wanted to convey to the to the community that yes, it is difficult for us to kind of achieve the bold numbers that we have given out, but I think we are very well on track to achieve those numbers. I think with that I will hand it over to Kaitav and Kaitav may want to open the floor for questions.\n",

      "Nirav Shah: Sure, so we had during a last call we had given a guidance that we would be doing an equity fundraising process and you know by end of this financial year and that process is something that is currently on. Even in case where we are still not able to achieve or being able to raise that equity, we will still believe that with our co-lending approach, we should be good enough for the next 12 to 18 months timeframe and still be able to achieve the same numbers. With respect to your question on the leverage, we have always believed that we would cap our leverage at four times debt-to-equity ratio and there is still a long way you know from the current 2.85x leverage that we have at this point in time.\n",

So, by restricting us there is no hard coded 4x debt-to-equity ratio that you know we are saying. What we are saying is that once we achieved that or we approach to that number then we should be looking at other avenues of fundraising, it could be equity as Kishore said it could be Tier-2 debt etc. etc. While with our vintage we are pretty much sure that we can still reach five to five and half times debt to equity ratio but just to be within our limits and to have a very clear visibility, we are saying we will preferably not want to go beyond 4x at this point in time. That also leaves something what we call as is a confidence capital on table for the other large debt you know participants like Public Sector Banks etc. who would become very comfortable when it is sub 4x leverage.\n",

      "Anil Tulsiram: Okay. Sir, and my next question is on the account aggregator. I think it is going to get implemented from the early next year and once it gets implemented, what they are trying to do with the growth rate that any bank will be able to do it means collecting the account statements and the GST data, so in what way it will be difficult for them to replicate what we are doing or means how the underwriting is much more beyond just this bank statement and GST that is what basically I want to understand?\n",

      "Anuj Pandey: I will pick it up. In fact, account aggregation and the account aggregated model is already live and there are about 10 banks which are already live and what it does is basically on one consent of the customer it allows the financier to fetch all its bank accounts. Eventually, all its financial assets will get added in this network, that is the broad plan. Now to your question of whether this will truly democratize the banking data and hence how we are different if I understood you correctly to tell you the banking data is still available to all including the banks themselves. The point is whether you are able to apply them in a smart way in a statistical model to your chosen target segment that is where a proprietary work and insight-based work comes upon. Now today our underwriting is primarily based on GST, banking and repayment. Now these are things which are available to all for last five years, but still basis the application of a machine learning algorithm on our chosen target segment we have been evolving the underwriting model and that is something which takes time and hence whosoever chooses to do that of course can do for their own chosen target segment but in that journey, we think we would be always two to three years ahead.\n",

My first question was on the co-lending side specifically on you know our GRO-extreme platform. So, we have you know a partners fintech NBFCs that we've partnered with who also have their own platforms, like you have lending cart which has that together platform, you have Yubi with co-lend platform. So, my question on GRO-Extreme is you've said that you want to grow it to be the biggest platform for co-lending in India where you know even the smallest of the NBFCs can get in touch with the largest of banks. So, my question is one what do you see as the USP of our platform when compared to the other platforms that exist and what are your goals you know how do you see the progress and what's the timeline on that, that is the first question?\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (0.986)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Anuj Pandey: Okay, so, overall, the difference is in the concept because we are a large lender ourselves so when a balance sheet provider makes a platform which can be integrated with other lenders and other partners are then the Insight which it brings for example, we have a proprietary GRO score which is already developed and now is getting proved quarter-on-quarter on our chosen MSME segment. Now if someone, if a partner wants to use that for their data that would be available to us but our approach has always been complementing and not competing so for example we are integrating with the Yubi‚Äôs of the world and other such platforms are typically what happens is in a PSU Bank especially on one or it is very difficult for them to integrate with many platforms and it might so happen that one of these platforms get integrated first. Our approach has been to either integrate directly or integrate via these platforms so that overall, we are able to serve the needs of the ecosystem Wayne D‚ÄôMello: Okay, that makes sense.\n",

      "Amit Mande: One more thing on that is GRO score being, so one more thing is the ability on the smaller NBFCs model, your smaller NBFCs also the larger banks and the NBFCs to use the proprietary GRO score which is the real value add so, one is the platform; two is the intellectual property value and of the GRO score for each of these partners to access and evaluate the portfolio; and third of course is the ability to be a lender to the smaller NBFCs. So, it is little different than with a platform like a Yubi which is only a platform that connects multiple partners. Wayne D‚ÄôMello: Yeah, understood, thanks for the reply. So, yeah on co-lending again by 2025 we've guided for you know 50% of our book to be off book off that I think you said around 20-23% will be through co-lending, right?\n",

So, do you have any thoughts on, are you flexible with taking it up from the 50% that you've guided for?\n",

      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Amit Mande: So, at this point of time the guidance is 50% and there is an opportunity to further increase it to higher percentages. There are two things that we are currently look at it. (A just being a platform has to be acceptable because then we are just 10%, we are just a platform and so whether the people whom we are co-lending with they don't find skin in the game and so that acceptance has to yet be proved. So, the opportunity still rests but we don't just want to be a passive platform and a lender, we want to know how our skin in the games are. At this point of time, we exercise 50 if the opportunity permits, we could further take it up as we as time goes by. At the current point in time, we anyways on month-on-month are of booking 50% of our disbursement you would have seen our off-book AUM now at 29% of the total AUM, which has moved from 21% in the last quarter. So. it's moving very rapidly, so like you said there is opportunity, but we would like to keep skin in the game, you would like to give that confidence to our co- lenders and so 50% is what we believe is the right number to reach by 2025. Wane D‚ÄôMello: Okay, thank you. And one last question is just for the sake of investors like how do you guys define collection efficiency so we are at 94%. So, you know what comprises the rest of the 6%?\n",

Typically, in other Financial Services Industry a lot of people give collection efficiency by dividing the total collection by current due, if we do that, our connection efficiency would be closer to 99%. So, this rest 6% is what flows into what we call buckets. The first bucket is called bucket X, typically in that bucket X our resolution rates are around 97-98%.

      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Amit Mande: So, two ways to look at it. One, the competition has always been there. The MSME segment has always been a hot segment where the banks always wanted to build their portfolios in there, not only the banks or the institutional push but there is a larger strategic approach from the government itself towards the NBFCs. So, the competition is there in that segment. On one side, there is competition, Banks, and liquidity on the other side people talk about the credit Gap that is there in the MSME segment. So, between these two things one would have realized that delivery of credit to the MSME is an extremely difficult subject that people thought it was and large focus has always been on the consumer segment like the personal loans or the vehicle loans, etc. what we've been able to do is really focus by sector and by geographies into the MSME segment so our dedicated and committed Focus has also led us to build a risk model that is unique and can scale up. So, in that sense we have a better risk and underwriting model and that is why our turnaround times to the customers and ability to assess and understand customers is better and so while we appreciate and we really respect the competition that is there in the market, we believe that we have a unique proposition because of which we will stay ahead of the competition. So, whether it is the segment that we are, whether it is the micro enterprises segment, or the machinery finance segment or for that matter the business loan secure and unsecure, our proposition is to work on data and technology and give fast turnaround time versus the customer right and that has helped us, that has been the real driver of our growth in last three quarters.\n",

The learning curve has been, we always believed that there would be a learning curve and so this year we decided to not expand and see how these branches become profitable so that it really powers our growth going forward. What we've seen is today as we speak from the 75 branches that we have 31 branches that have already broken even, and we will see the entire set of 75 branches breaking even by end of this year which means that the break-even period of between 12 to 15 months that we expected, and the model is working.

So our slippage ratio or credit cost ratio should be close to this number but that's not the case so I know Collection efficiency is not a rolling number as in customer who didn't pay in August, would have paid in September and would have dropped off the bucket but there is this huge gap so and if I see your 30-day past due 30 DPD is around 5-6% and then there is a drop off in the 90 day pass due to 1 ‚Äì 2 %. So, can you explain this client behavior. Are they always you know they pass their due for a few days and then when they get their cash, they pay it back.\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (0.985)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Anuj Pandey: Okay two things, one the understanding of how the flow rates works. So, typically whatever is bounced will move into DPDs or what we call collection buckets. Typically, there are four collection buckets between 0 to 30 days past due 30 to 60, 60 to 90 and 90 and beyond, which basically means whether you have one EMI due, two EMIs due, 3 EMIs due or more EMIs than 3 which are due. For our kind of target segment typically in the first bucket the resolution rates are closer to 95, 96, 97% because this is a function of the nature of the target segment this is an SME, he may not have the money on the due date, but he is fine paying the amount in that calendar month. Then if there is more than one EMI due then typically the resolution rates are between 70 to 80%. If there are more than 2 EMIs dues, the resolution rates will fall obviously, and it is around 50 to 60% and then the case becomes NPA and then the recovery rate depending on the product which is about 20 to 25%. So, when you multiply all of them together you get a number which is called Product of flows that is the number which gives an indication of how much of your current asset is likely to become NPA in the subsequent three months. That number for us is between 0.1 to 0.15% and this is the number we keep tracking regularly. The number which you quoted for 30+ and 90 + I think we're a little different our 30 + number end of September is 3.5%. So, there are 3.5% of the portfolio where the customers have not paid more than one EMI.\n",

So any color on that and for this segment that you have cater to the MSME sector, is 1.5% build cost the right number or is it slightly on the lower side compared to the other banks, because even the banks that are your co-lending partners they have credit cost almost 2% or upwards, so any insights on this credit cost piece and why there was an increase in this?\n",

      "Anuj Pandey: Okay, so the credit cost increased primarily because the disbursals increased. So, the way credit costs are done, whatever you have disbursed newly. You assign a provision which used to be called good book provisioning or standard provisioning. So, because our disbursals in this quarter has gone up that's why the credit cost has gone up that typically is about 1% off of the new business generated. As far as your comparative credit costs are concerned, yes, we are a little lower and we would like to remain that way because our underwriting is very different than a typical SME lender underwriting. We have been using our SME GRO score database underwriting in a very different way so our estimates are that it will always be little lower than what our peers are.\n",

So, at this point of time whether it is State Bank of India or Central Bank or Bank of Baroda or PSB, the limits allocated are way higher than what we have for co-lend with them today. So at this point of time we do see any reason why we should go back to even change the limits we will come to this question maybe another year down the line or six-eight months down the line having said this some of the banks that we are the largest co-lending partners there our co-lending book with the banks is now upwards of 600 crores and we are seeing more and more demand and more and more push from these public sector banks to co-lenders and so at this point of time we do not have problems with the limits.\n",

      "Anuj Pandey: So typically, the provision coverage ratios for stage 3 asset keep going up as the vintage of portfolio keeps going up and it is also should be seen in light of your absolute gross NPAs and net NPS. So, what one wants to balance out is that the uncovered portion of your NPAs should not be very high. So today our net NPA is only about 1.2% and hence at this point of time we are very comfortable with 30% provision coverage ratio but as our portfolio matures, as the book size increases this provision coverage will also keep increasing gradually.\n",

      "Nikhil Kumar Agarwal: Hi good evening! My name is Nikhil Agarwal, I am from BT Capital. So, sir first of all congratulations on the successful set of results. I just have a couple of questions. First about the FLDG model, so I just wanted to get it clear view on how FLDG works because uh so there was this regulation that Banks and NBFCs cannot do FLDG together. So NBFCs and NBFCs have to do together something like that so if you could give me a clear view on how FLDG works and how we are doing it in the correct way so if you could just explain that and my second question is about credit cost that sir you say that with this disbursals are provisions are going up and although we are comfortable at the 30% level right now with the increase in vintage, assets provision will go up and at the same time it seems that our credit cost will remain under the current levels of 1.5-1.6%. So, is this going to be true because with increasing provisions and the increasing disbursements and AUM targets that we have I think there could be a further increase in credit cost. So can you please explain these two things.\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (0.963)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Anuj Pandey: So, I'll answer the second question first. While we are talking about the provision coverage ratio, we were talking about the provision coverage on stage 3 assets or NPA assets and then we are talking about the total credit cost, we are talking about the total credit cost on the overall book. So, they are two different things, although they are related in an indirect way but should not be seen together the way you have interpreted. The more disbursals we do, the stage 1 provision, which is the book which is correct that will keep going up. As our NPAs go up and the vintage of the NPAs within the stage 3 goes up, the provision coverage will keep increasing for stage 3. So, they both can exist together. Overall, in our calculation and in our annual plans and for the plans up to 2025, we see that overall combined both stage 1, stage 2, and stage 3, the credit cost should remain in the vicinity of 1.5-1.6%. Within this the stage 3 provision coverage ratio will keep going up.\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (0.526)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Nikhil Kumar Agarwal: Sr, just one follow up regarding this. So, I was not confused between the stage 1 provision and the stage 2 provision. I just wanted to know that from the incremental Provisions flowing through P&L major part of it would be for the NPA Provisions because vintage would go up, is that a fair assumption or please correct me if I'm wrong?\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (1.0)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Anuj Pandey: No, so it will be as long as our annual disbursals are contribution in the total AUM is higher in the vicinity of so today for example, we are at an AUM of 4400-crore with about 1300-crore getting disbursed in last quarter itself which basically means that 25 of the total book has been recently sourced. So, this figure will keep going as the portfolio keeps going up, this contribution of freshly sourced portfolio will keep coming down and that will have an impact but having said that the trade cost is also a function of our portfolio construct. We are very clear that 70% of the portfolio will remain secured and 30% can remain unsecured. Now in unsecured when it starts getting delinquent and start moving to stage 3 then the provision coverage on that part increases in an accelerated way. While in secured we have seen that the recoveries happen and hence one is able to pull it back. So, the approach is a twin. One is to keep steady on our portfolio design and also keep having a very close monitoring on the contribution of recently sourced portfolio to the overall portfolio.\n",

      "Amit Mande: Let me take the first question and your question on the FLDG and is it allowed between the banks and the NBFCs or NBFCs to NBFCs. So, we do co-lending and co-origination as two sides of our business. One is with the banks for on the liability side as we call it. With the banks the FLDG, there is no FLDG that is allowed. Risk is on the pari passu basis which means that 20% risk is ours and 80% risk is with the bank that's one. Two, between the NBFCs to NBFCs which are both regulated entities FLDG is what we do as well as guided by the securitization compliance as a guidance and so on the asset side all our definitive partnerships and lending partnerships are regulated entities and we have we have our first loss coverage from them in accordance securitization guideline, have I been able to answer the question on what is the difference and with whom are we doing what?\n",

      "Amit Mande: So, we can take FLDG up to 20% depending upon what product and what kind of so every partner on the asset side we have a common lending policy that's one and basis the policy it could range anywhere between 10 to 20% depending upon the product, geographies, or the way the operations are evaluated by risk.\n",

      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Kishor Lodha: So, I will take this question. So, there are two sets of co-lending guidelines called, scheme 1 and scheme 2. Scheme 1, there you do co-lending on a pari passu basis where both the counterparties jointly lend to the customer so if customer is there willing to take 100-rupee loans based on the joint lending program both the parties are funding the ratio of the agreement. So, if the bank is taking 80% and the NBFC is taking 20% at the stage of origination both these party will evaluate the customer and if the customer they didn't fit on the escrow account proportionate funds will move and from there the disbursal will happen. Here uh the accounting would be like a normal lending accounting where 20% units recognize by interest and on the 80% where the bank is funding the differential interest if any is there has to be accounted in the books of the originators. In direct assignment where you first originate the customer in your book and then downsize it to the bank or the partner depending upon the co-lending program and the ratios so 80-20 is the most common practice. So, in that case the income is treated like direct assignment where you have to upfront the lifetime income of that particular loan converting into the deferred asset and recognizing your P&L.\n",

      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Amit Mande: So to answer I think first of all want us to understand the spirit of the guideline. The spirit of the guideline says that the lender cannot be a passive lender and so should take active part in the risk assessment and risk management so that's one. Two uh it also talks about regulated and non-regulated entities, or I partially answered this all our partners on the asset side where we do co-lending and co- origination are regulated entities, which means that where the FLDG and that is our opinion FLDG is not applicable to a partnership between a non-regulated and a regulated entity. We do not have such relationships. All our relationships are regulated and so FLDG continues to be a part of the agreement that's one. Two uh because these are all regulated entities all three important or rather four important parameters that are defined in the guidelines one is disbursement into the customer account, two repayments from the customer directly into an escrow or our own account, three the E-customer fact sheet and four the IP audit. All these have been carried out across all partnerships and we are compliant across all relationships so that has not impacted us at all. It is absolutely similar with the banks that we co-lend with and so we do not have any impact on the draft digital lending guidelines.\n",

      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (0.998)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Shachindra Nath: We started with this in our last quarter. Our belief is that like consumer credit business in India, the small business financing is also rapidly embracing the data driven underwriting. Since start of demonetisation and advent of GST and creation of three layer of India data stack is ensuring that in over next two to three years, the entire SME credit space would move to a data driven underwriting. The identity layer, the payment layer, and the data layer combined with the power of multiple alternative sources of data would move the credit into three different forms of credit which we call embedded credit, flow-based credit, and buy now pay later and this is also massively supported now. Once fully implemented the OCEN Network and the ONDC would make the merchant financing business very permanent. We have been saying this over a period of last many quarters that there is a transformation of NBFC lending space is happening. The NBFC lending space is getting divided between some very large-capitalized, owner driven NBFCs, and the larger ecosystem which must converge to lending as a service. We have seen the LaaS companies across Europe, UK, and US, but India is now seeing an evolution of lending as a service. What basically it means that unlike conventionally all of you have seen that lending outside the bank through NBFC is a business of leverage versus now it is becoming business of service. On one side of the spectrum, where we specialize, in being able to find or what we call source filter underwrite the customer. On the other side of the spectrum, we have the owners of the liability or the liquidity which are banks and large financial institutions. The way we design ourself that while we are a principal lender, we have a highly capitalised balance sheet and we borrow on our balance sheet, but our eventual goal is to be able to service the large ecosystem of small businesses in India, being able to filter them, use our data driven underwriting and clear them through our score and finally the balance sheet belongs to the large banks and that creates a very large fee generating model for businesses like NBFCs or Fintech whatever we may want to call it. Our next few slides we will explain that how we are evolving from a leverage business to LaaS as a business but over this Q1 we have been able to prove that this is happening. We have been able to cumulatively disburse 6000+ crores over a period of last four years of which roughly around two years were lost. We have an asset under management of 3650 crore which is a growth of almost 700+ crore over a period of one quarter and we have an off-book AUM of 780 odd crores. So, from a 16% of our balance sheet, which was off our books, now we have moved to 21%. We are now servicing 25,000 plus customers. We have a physical footprint of become a company which services the need of an SME or MSME customer right from a small ‚Çπ1-lakh loan to ‚Çπ5-crores of credit in different format of what we call the product through multiple distribution. So, we have ability to do secured business loan machinery, unsecured business loan, and micro enterprises loan, supply chain financing and merchant financing which is a digital platform which will be coming soon. I hand it over to Anuj to talk to you about how the data ecosystem in UGRO has evolved and what data could be doing to the MSME financing ecosystem in India.\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (0.917)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Anuj Pandey: Thank you Shachindra. So, over the next couple of slides, I will just take you all through how the digital ecosystem has evolved and how we seem to be in the right place at the right time with right set of design and execution capabilities to have a meaningful impact on the very large lending opportunity which is present across SME lending in India. And first thing first, a very quick review on how we have evolved in last three-four years. How we have been able to apply data analytics in technology not only in the very core area of underwriting, which I will explain in detail in later slides but also in other aspects of our institution. In fact, we have been readily using comprehensive data lead insights in early warning systems. We have applied the same approach in our operations and collections team at the origination level. Right from day one, we have been using it to a very large extent, in fact, to open our new branches in micro locations, we have used data science extensively. So, overall, not only in underwriting we have seen and found a lot of advantages in using technology and data platforms across. So, we will probably be one of the first large scale NBFCs to do that. At the very heart of what we have done is what we call a GRO Score. When we started in January 2019 with our first loan, we were using the first version of our GRO Score which was based on a simple hypothesis and design that when you look at the customer via the lens of the sector in which it operates, one is able to understand his cash flow in much better way and hence one is able to predict the portfolio performance much better and this got severely tested and we passed that test successfully during both pandemic one and pandemic two. Our portfolio has remained intact and is in much better shape vis-√†-vis competition and during that impact we learnt that the banking behaviour also is a very key contributor in predicting future portfolio performance for SMEs. So, we launched our GRO Score 2.0 version which made use of not only the repayment behavior analysed through the lens of ecosystem but also the banking behavior and it became a very-very powerful tool. We implemented that in July of 2021 and as of March 2022, data is now sufficiently analyzed, and we can see that directionally we have found a way to template and standardise and scale an underwriting methodology for across SMEs in India. Our ambition now is to include the GST data as well and internally we called this GRO Score 3.0. The target is to launch it by the end of 3rd quarter in this year and once we do that, then it becomes a real tripod and one of the most powerful tools in underwriting to SMEs and this has been done by our own portfolio generated data, has been very thoroughly tested statistically. We have analysed more than 45,000 bank statements and more than 21,000 applications have been processed post our GRO Score 2.0 application. So, from as far as statistical rigor is concerned, we haven't left any stone unturned, and we really want our GRO Score to become the benchmark as far as underwriting to SMEs is concerned. Just a little more on how the GRO Score works and the basis of that of how what we can do is a very extensive library of about 25,000 extracting data features which can eventually be used to correlate with portfolio performance and now a third layer of GST is planned to being added there. This, we had referred to in our last call as well but this is a very important slide because it is telling us that directionally it is possible to completely templatize the way SMEs are underwritten. Very simply our new GRO Score 2.0 which is live since July of 2021 classifies all customers which we underwrite in five risk bands and depending on that risk band there is a probability of default which is assigned and now we have already seen data for customers who are now more than 6 months and up to 12 months where the risk stacking where a GRO Score ‚ÄúA ‚Äú customer which is the least risky versus a GRO Score ‚ÄúE‚Äù customer which is the most risky, their performance both on our books and both off books where we have been tracking their performance with other financiers is stacking up the way it should be. In the longer run, we would want to reach a situation where physical underwriting inference and input becomes as low as possible. The underwriters‚Äô role would be to do a quality reference check and apply his mind to improve the scorecard and the machine taking over and, in that direction, this is a very important step. All this was made possible if you recall people who have been listening to our story because we are focused on our customers via the lens of the sector in which they operate. So, when we started and the endeavor was to look at sectors which are large, where the macro and microeconomic parameters were favorable in short to medium term and there was enough data available to make use of. So, we had done a very large exercise with CRISIL and we have chosen eight sectors in which our target segments were smaller SMEs where we can give loans up to ‚Çπ5-crores and these eight sectors were healthcare, hospitality, light engineering, auto components, education, electrical equipment, chemicals, and food processing. We also, during our journey about one and half years back, introduced a new sector which we called micro enterprises because we realised and industry data was telling us that this differentiation basis sector was not really applicable if the size of the enterprise is very small. The size itself was a differentiator. So, we included a new sector called micro enterprises where the focus was on very small businesses with loans up to 25-Lakh. So, today we have focused on these nine sectors, eight of our original plus ninth which came about last year. And now I will ask Amit to take over and he can take you through how we have designed in terms of technology, our product structure, and the financial numbers over to you Amit.\n",

      "Amit Mande: Thank you Anuj. And like you rightly said this is to all due to our GRO Score, our proprietary GRO Score, we call it the magic sauce, sometimes we call it the Coke formula, remains at the heart of everything that we do. So, around this GRO Score is what we have really built the robust tech platform. There was a need for a strong platform. There was a need for differentiated platforms to harness the power of data. This remains at the heart of our robust technology platform. There was a need to have customised differentiated platforms to harness every ecosystem and what this slide really shows is a different platform. Our GRO+ platforms look at, intermediary distribution in the prime branches. Our GRO Direct is where we go direct to the customer. GRO Chain is an interesting, high end platform that allows us to harness the ecosystems of the anchors and the suppliers on a supply chain business and the most important Mr. Nath did touch upon this as our route to becoming lending as a service entity, our extremely important platform, our GRO Xstream actually connects the fintechs and the NBFCs on one side, the public sector banks on the other designed products starting from ‚Çπ50 Thousand to ‚Çπ5 crores. Products that have tenures from 30 days to around 15 years and all kinds of needs being serviced. What really this GRO Score does is a GRO Score really credit evaluates customer and then if he is worth delivering credit to depending upon what kind of product he wants is the customer price, the customer is priced depending upon what kind of security he brings on the table and so we are able to do multiple products like loan against property, we do a productive asset financing, unsecured loans, supply chain and our micro enterprise loans all of these revolve around this one simple concept of GRO Score and is supported by our platform. More importantly on the distribution side, we are now at about 96 locations. So, I was talking that our distribution strength continues to improve quarter-on-quarter. We are now in 96 locations, more than 1000 GRO partners. Our ecosystem of anchors and OEMs who power our supply chain and the productive asset financing machinery finance business again has been growing quarter-on-quarter and of course our employee strength at the front end now is more than 700 people that work on all these platforms. If we were to look at how our distribution is we have realised that there are multiple customer cohorts that we want to reach to and we have very different distribution models. Our branch lead channel looks at the Prime branches and the micro branches, they service the intermediary distribution, they take to the customers our loan against property, our affordable LAP, our unsecured loans business, our ecosystem business, distribution model actually harnesses the ecosystems of the anchors for the supply chain both on the vendor and the distribution side. It harnesses the ecosystem of the OEMs for the machinery finance business. On the GRO Xstream platform, on one side there are large number of partnership and alliances, NBFCs and Fintechs where we do very differentiated products with them to reach to the last mile and most importantly direct to customer digital channel that will now get enhanced by end of August to really step up our customer acquisition engine and this will be one of its kind direct to customer channel that we will launch in August. We will of course see the launch that will be a visible launch and we will be able to divulge lot of more information possibly in the next quarter. But as we continue to build our distribution as we continue to build our asset book, one important thing I wanted to talk about the lending as a service platform. As we continue to build this, our partnerships with the PSU Banks and the NBFCs for co-lending and SFCs continue to increase. In last quarter we had about five, we are now increasing this. We have got Punjab and Sind Bank on board, we have signed with Punjab and Sind Bank for all products. By next quarter, we will have another two banks having signed up. So, that takes care not only of just our liability position but our ability to off book our AUM, look at how beautiful the off booking of AUM continues to grow quarter-on-quarter. So, last quarter we were at about 16%, this quarter we are at 21% of our AUM off book and this is thanks to all our partnerships with the PSU Banks and some large leading NBFCs where we do co-lending and co-origination\n",

We had a great first quarter, our AUM stands at about 3,656 crores, off book AUM is at 21%. Our net total income remains healthy at 10.5% and importantly our credit cost is very much under control and so it is at about 1.4%.

      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (1.0)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Chinmaya Bhargava: Hi, good afternoon. Nice to see you all and congratulations on the numbers this quarter. I have about three questions on the business. So, let's get started. The first question is on our GRO Score and we spent a lot of time explaining this, but I have a few more basic questions with the GRO Score itself. We have 25,000 data points as you have said, right, but the more data points we add to a model, the more complex relationship becomes between the data and more noise and contradictions you will have between different data points. What framework do we use to choose which data amongst that huge set to prioritize and could you tell me for using like a Bayesian Framework, Stochastic Framework how are we using our probability models and more basically if we take a case study right like if we discuss nursing homes for example can you tell me how our understanding of this single business has changed from GRO one to GRO three where we are now?\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (0.994)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Subrata Das: The first part of question which says there are 25,000 attributes and the method used. So, first of all it is a future library. It is a total universe of parameters which could be potentially used to predict the probability of default and you are right in saying that not all of them could be used without loss of significance. The approach that we take is we make as many parameters as possible based on our functional and business expertise and that maximizes our chances of fitting a very powerful model which holds the test of blacklisting. Having said that there is a scientific and elaborate method of reducing those dimensions into eventually a set of around 35 to 40. The approach that we use you mentioned Bayesian and Stochastic processes what we use is basically supervised learning techniques because we are predicting zero or one outcome or a good or bad outcome on a training dataset and we follow a very well-defined objective framework to gradually reduce the 25,000 to the set of 35 or 40 most important significant parameters which have least correlation with each other; however, in conjunction are most powerful in predicting the default. The exact formula or the system of base which is used to arrive at the probability of default that is the part which we keep as proprietary to ourselves. GRO 1 to GRO 3?\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (0.998)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Subrata Das: So, when we did GRO 1, we had very little data of our own and we were working in conjunction with a Large Credit Bureau and developing models on something that we call look alike population one that best resembles our target segment; however, they were not our datasets. From there, we moved onto 2.0 which is currently invoke since July 2021 which has two major components, one that being developed on our own incoming data and with all in-house models predicts much more sharply. Second, it combines the Credit Bureau history of the borrowers both the commercial entity as well as the individual applicants as well as the bank statement into one consolidated scoring model. And 3.0 is going to incorporate the GST records of the entity and thereby it is going to be first of its kind a very robust predictive model which captures the intensity of business in a real time GST. The financial discipline of the intent to pay through the Bureau record and the ability to pay through so let say the current cash situation and the credits and debits visible in the bank statement.\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (0.996)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Chinmaya Bhargava: Okay. Two follow ups there, so one the recent push from the RBI to on board the PSU banks to the account aggregators, do you think that is a significant data point for us to improve our model?\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (0.773)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Shachindra Nath: Yes.\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (1.0)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Subrata Das: Definitely, yes, it is. I think it just depends on how much of participation we see in what span of time but in a destination state where account aggregator has the participation of the entire banking sector that it can change things.\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (1.0)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Shachindra Nath: Currently the problem is a friction. So, today banking which is one of the most important component to assess the cash flow of a customer so what we say ability to pay come from a physical bank statement and the conversion and the friction from physical to a data and being able to analyse that requires multiple level of curing and intervention but when the same dataset would come from account aggregation it becomes very efficient and second one of the big constraint for a non-bank lender is that our ability to refresh this data on a periodic basis. So account aggregation not just for the bank but also GST being part of that would allow us to fetch the same data on periodic basis and update our model and look at the point of lending what is the risk associated but it improves our AWS model early warning signals model, Anuj if you want to add something to that.\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (0.505)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Anuj Pandey: Yeah right, so basically today whenever they are getting data it is at the time of acquisition and there is no way that we get data for monitoring purposes. Once account aggregation is fully live and all the banks are that would be much more robust.\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (0.998)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Chinmaya Bhargava: I can imagine. So, it is real time data which allows you to understand very quickly how sensitive the models are to change. Okay, last question on the proof of concept here, the proof of concept that we have uploaded so far is for GRO 2.0. Will we have anything out for the newer models like do you expect it to be better?\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (0.999)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Anuj Pandey: The new model is expected to go live only in December 2022. So, it is right now in the development phase. So, once we implement that we will require some time for some data to get set and established and post that we will do that, but there is a framework already of whenever we launch a new model what kind of testing we want to do in terms of back testing and once it goes live then at what rate we should do proof of concept.\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (1.0)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Chinmaya Bhargava: Brilliant, thank you.\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (0.999)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Shachindra Nath: I think I just want to add that the difference between 2 and 3, the 2 predict the default, categories the customer in five band. 3 would be able to predict the default as it is being done in 2.0 but also would be able to predict the ability of the customer whether the customer can afford 100,000 worth of loan or a 250,000 worth of loan which is today is estimated through a policy and product program on the front end so that is the core difference.\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (0.999)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Chinmaya Bhargava: Okay. So, your approval rates, false positives all of that will improve, your Early Warning Systems with real time data all of that will improve. I have one last question from my side which is if I look at now our sector mix this quarter and I compare it to Q1 FY 22, I can see that education and hospitality which comprised about 15% of our book is now down to below 5% for example, I know this was because of restructuring but my question is what is our plan for education and hospitality going forward? Are we going to be looking at a different sector? Do you see it returning to giving us the scale that we choose it in the past months?\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (0.509)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Anuj Pandey: So, we are already seeing a lot of encouraging signs in both these sectors, both in terms of our own portfolio, which is a good portfolio which has been restructured and lot of demand also seems to now getting up especially in education with children coming going back to school. So, slowly the plan is to keep building this up.\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (1.0)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Chinmaya Bhargava: Okay. Thank you so much and all the best. I will just back in the que. company and how is it integrated with the GRO ecosystem that you have?\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (0.995)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Anuj Pandey: Okay, I will answer that. So OCEN, is Open Credit Enablement Network. The broad concept of this network is to have data in a marketplace which is driven data storage which is given by a protocol which is standardised across. The first used case of OCEN in India is a platform called GeM SAHAY where we were the first lender. So, the way it works is that GeM (Government e Marketplace) is a marketplace, SAHAY is the OCEN Network over and above that where on one side the sellers are SMEs and the buyers are PSUs and the data of their transaction is stored in that marketplace in a format which is universal. That data we have integrated with the GeM SAHAY platform. We were the first ones but there are many more financers which are doing that. It accesses the moment any SME gets an order on GeM, then their previous history of that transaction and SMEs demographic is available for a financer to make use of form business rules around that data and do an instant approval for that case. We are already live in that. More and more OCEN framework-based platforms will keep coming up once more and more people start adopting that and as far as we are concerned, our business rule engines and the API network is ready whenever need arises to further integrate.\n",

      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Samyak Shah: Okay, okay, understood. The other question is regarding the expansion model. So, would it be more branch based going forward or would the focus be more towards digital penetration like any numbers on this?\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (1.0)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Amit Mande: In our earlier plan we did have a large expansion plan this year on the micro piece. Now the micro branches, we do micro secured which is a high yield secured product and is a focus product for us but today with 75 branches over next two quarters we want to make it highly profitable and then focus on further expansion of micro branches. Any expansions further from here will only be on micro branches, on the prime branches where we do the intermediated business, we don't see any large expansion plans. That is number one. Number two, the expansion will be in products of machinery finance, supply chain, and direct-to-customer which essentially means that to some questions that somebody earlier asked what our direct distribution is and what is our intermediate distribution. Our focus is to keep improving our direct distribution going forward with micro branches and with the businesses where there is direct to ecosystem and there are no intermediaries. So, did I answer your questions in terms of what are the plans on distribution and expansion?\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (0.953)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Samyak Shah: So, it will be selective in terms of which areas require intermediation like a personal contact with customer so like as you said in the micro area?\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (1.0)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Amit Mande: The answer is that we will continue to expand our micro branches where there is a direct to customer digitally assisted footprint and a direct to customer digital acquisition. approval or loan application process, so is there anything you are doing for improving awareness about how to go about this online loan application procedure?\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (0.995)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Amit Mande: Two things, one the moment I said that we are going micro branches, direct distribution we have feet on street. So, it is in customer assisted model and we will assist the customers to run through their customer journeys. On the direct to customers, we will start with very simple small tickets, small tenure products where the data requirement is very low and eventually take this up to a more complex product where we need data on their GSTs, where we need data on their securities, their properties or whether its machinery. Initially direct to consumer will always be a little simple journey, simple data requirements and over a period we will graduate with the customers to a higher end product.\n",

      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Shachindra Nath: If you look at few of our slides you can see that. As of March-22, 16% of our book was off book, as of Q1 and it is 21%. As of we are targeting as of FY23 to be 35%.\n",

      "Manish Agarwal: Congratulations on good set of numbers sir. Just a couple of questions I have like this time in presentation there is no mention about provision coverage ratio or NIMs. So could you help me with that number, what are the NIMs in this quarter. parameter to judge us because we may have a higher cost of borrowing vis-a-vis some of the large rated NBFC but our liability come from co-lending or off balance sheeting because that may be at much lower rate. Our gross income component is our interest income plus the fee income which comes from off balance sheet minus our cost of capital and that's why broadly it has not been given but just to get you a sense of our portfolio it is around 16.5% and cost of borrowing is 10.5%, Nirav if I'm correct unless you can clarify.\n",

      "Manish Agarwal: 28%? Okay. And sir just one thing I just need to qualify, I heard somewhere that the company is making fund for the employees where they would be buying the shares from the market. Is it the right information or just news?\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (1.0)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Shachindra Nath: No, it is a right information sir. So, I think if you look at our exchange disclosure in our result board meeting, our Board has approved and fresh ESOP scheme. This ESOP scheme is only for purchase of shares through secondary market as at per SEBI regulation we can do that up to 5% and in a particular year we can do up to 2% of the total market capitalization so our Board has approved a loan to an employee welfare trust which is the quantum is roughly around 30 crore and this money would be utilized to buy shares from the would be held in the trust for the benefit of employees.\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (1.0)\n",

      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (1.0)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Shachindra Nath: Loan given to a trust, so SEBI regulation on ESOP allows this that either they have an ESOP which can be directly given by the company, or you can implement in ESOP through a trust. So there is a loan which would be given to the trust and that loan money can be utilized to buy share from the secondary market.\n",

      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (1.0)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Chet: Hi! congratulations on the good set of numbers especially in AUM and fee income. I had 4 questions which have accumulated. I will just start with the most recent conversation we had. So, on ESOPs, will this transaction count towards the 8% cap in the Articles of Association.\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (0.837)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Shachindra Nath: So, we have Sir 5.88% which is the ESOP and I think so you are right this will be roughly around 8% in total. I think so we're going for a shareholder approval, so absolute quantum is 30 crores and if this quantum because we don't know what real percentage of shareholding we would be able to acquire because it is a function of price and in a particular year you cannot do more than 2% but if its process that cap percentage of 8% when we are going for shareholder approval whatever is the calculation we will request for shareholders to approve for that change.\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (1.0)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Chet: That's great, okay. Then the second question was on the competitive landscape in co-lending. So if in co- lending the fees say that we are the leading partner for banks especially PSU banks who have issues with you know front book growth and front book quality who is our next competitor and you know how far ahead are we you know in terms of using the data tripod etc. terms of this co-lending as a business model let me give you some perspective. So, there are, look at from a large public sector banks perspective, think of an SBI or Bank of Baroda, or a Union Bank most of them would like to partner with an NBFC of substance. NBFC of substance means that they would look at some significant amount of capital, they will look at a profitable track record, they will look at healthy portfolio quality and some vintage and then would like to partner. So this is what banks want, now if you look at in terms of the market participant you have 3 types of and last but not least co-lending is only for priority sector so the asset class which can go in co-lending is either MSME, agri, or you know almost of them and nothing beyond that. So fortunately, then you look at the market participants so there are three types of participants. You have AAA to AA diversified large NBFCs, I think so for them because not necessarily that most of them are in priority sector, so there are lot of assets these large NBFCS do which is beyond priority sector and also for them it is much easier to do take a leverage on the balance sheet and continue doing the business as they want, because they there balance sheet could have a combination of wholesale, corporate credit, wheels business, you know SMEs, gold loans, so on and so forth. So, that is why most of those top 10 are large NBFCs are today not entering into co-lending and most of their asset classes are also not suited for a bank, and we have roughly around 50+ NBFCs, which are wide SME or Agri segment but are neither well capitalized nor the portfolio track record wherein they can get accepted by the bank. Anything between BBB- to a BBB+ companies and that‚Äôs why that segment of the market is also getting excluded. We at UGRO with a 1000 crore of capital with A rating and 5-year of vintage with very mass portfolio quality and focus on digitization, are becoming a preferred player for multiple banks to do co-lending with us. I'm not saying that we would only be the one who would be doing it, over a period there will be a convergence which would happen. The large NBFC would also start doing co-lending and smaller NBFC would become little, larger and do co-lending but we think so that we have a you know window of becoming market leader in next 3 years by the time this catch up happens.\n",

      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Chet: Okay, and in terms of in terms of micro branches, are they like a strong contributor in this co-lending portfolio and you know how do we avoid cannibalizing you know with our partner you know PSU banks?\n",

      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Shachindra Nath: Sir, yeah, micro branches would be bigger contributor in terms of the overall portfolio yield and profitability. In terms AUM growth, they may not be a very large contributor as of now, but they are increasing. All our banking partners are accepting our micro enterprises credit policy as a product for co-lending and gradually as the funnel would increase that would also start going into the co-origination lending.

      "Amit Mande: No absolutely Sachin and to answer the question the micro secured product that we have, is a great high yield product. It's behaving extremely well and so at this point of time it also makes sense to keep some high yield secured business on our books and so it will continue to be on books for a while and at the same point of time like Mr. Nath said we have already started doing micro secured co-lending in couple of banks and it will continue to slowly move into the co-lending.\n",

      "Amit Mande: Absolutely. So, there is a there's a clear policy on what we accept as a collateral, and these are very much in lines with what are acceptable by the banks and so that is essential reason Chet why even this product is today acceptable in a large PSU bank because of these.\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (0.999)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Chet: Yes, I got my answer. If SBI and Bank of Baroda are comfortable taking it so it needs to be one of list of 10 items. Great. Last question was on the QIP or the you know our leverage ratio basically so right now we are at a debt to equity of 2.3, you know obviously with co-lending it's not going to rise fast but as and when we reach 3 to 4 you know we would need to raise funds to expand considering that the stock price you know is a function of people you know volume as well we may need to do a QIP near book value, is this is something we have considered and have we considered the options. I don't need to know the options, but have you considered our options you know 6 months 9 months down the line.\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (0.542)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Shachindra Nath: Absolutely, so I was writing an answer to Tushar, I do not know the same person is speaking or not, I was just writing answer to him. So, first and foremost regulatory we are allowed to do up to 6 time of leverage but as a company in our initial first 5-7 years, we have said that we would lever ourselves only up to 3.5 or that our peers set currently the public market is very muted when it comes to the lending. No faults have occurred. The public market is muted because majority of the public market investors are worried about impact on the balance sheets of banks and NBFC and what is the adjusted book value and that's why they are not being able to ascribe a price and that is you know that is muting the interest in the lending as a segment of the market. Now we are completely out of that. We have no correlation, because pre-pandemic, post-pandemic we have demonstrated portfolio quality but once you are in a mix, you are in a mix and you cannot go beyond that but our view is that in you know as we continue to improve and show our growth there are you know intelligent set of investors who would come dedicated for us in that should improve our both price and also liquidity. Having said that our source of capital is not necessary only public market, our source of capital is multiple you know in a listed company will raise roughly around 950 crores of capital not going to the public market but from 4 large private equity investors. So source of capital today is available from private equity, DFIs, big family offices and multiple others who will compare or who are comparing us to the private market transactions where multiple NBFCs on fintech who are raising equity capital anything from 3 time price to book value to 7 or 8 time price to book value and you know while you get benchmark to you listed price but I think so that is the fair value where we should be and hopefully some of the private investor would look at from that eye and angle.\n",

      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (1.0)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Atul Prakash: Yeah, actually this thing, wanted to understand so we have mentioned that we are at 7,500 crore is our plan by FY23 AUM.\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (0.999)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Shachindra Nath: 7,000 crores.\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (1.0)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Atul Prakash: Pre-book from FY20 the AUM was approximately 800 to 900 between. So, we're growing a book to 9x in the matter of 3 years and then there is GRO Score card 1, there is GRO card 2, and GRO scorecard 3.0 is coming up so how we are very much confident this is also backed by the GNPA numbers. If we see, I think\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (0.584)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Shachindra Nath: So, I would say 3 things, I think so you are only looking the headline number, but you are not looking the incremental Opex which is being incurred to build a base. So, we raised our capital in July 2018, ILFS happened in September 2018. We started our business in April 19 even between the July 2018 to April 19 a base infrastructure for the company was created but given the liability market was extremely soft post ILFS, we decided only to deploy our capital. So out of 958 crore of capital we deployed 850 odd crores without leveraging our balance sheet and immediately after that the pandemic first round hit very hard and we shut down our business in first 6 months, but we were confident that we have to increase our infrastructure so as of FY20 were a company of 170 people, as of FY22 we were a company of 1,111 people. As of FY20, we are a company of 8 physical location as of FY22 we are a company of 91 physical location. As of FY 20 you know our technology team infrastructure was consisted of 5 people, as of FY22 it was 90 people, as of 20 to 22 our data analytics team was you know roughly around grown 5x. So, the growth is coming because this company has taken very early big Opex to build physical and digital infrastructure and basis that you know the growth is now coming. So, it's a base effect. Number 2 in terms of the portfolio quality I think so you know you can't back test its basis lower AUM because our first year AUM obviously we suffered from pandemic but we have demonstrated that during the pandemic we can control the portfolio quality much better than our peers set and only business than has to look at you know gross NPA on the basis of an expanding portfolio and you know by cohort portfolio quality and what is the early indicator. So, we are showing you an early indicator of how our portfolio quality basis data analytics is building up and what we think it would be the portfolio quality at future. Anuj, you want to add something please feel free.\n",

      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Anuj Pandey: So, I just want to add for a business model like ours, where now 21% of the book is off in form of co-lending and co-origination and eventually at the end of this year around 35% and in 2025 50%. A good perspective one can get if I look at the GNP by total AUM. So, in this quarter actually our GNPA is 1.7% if we add net NPA at 1.2% if you look at a total AUM, which is much more reflective of how the portfolio is doing and in addition to what Shachin you said in a growing portfolio specially the first year the denominator being lower and then facing two pandemics, post that whatever has come out we are quite confident that directionally we are stacking up well.\n",

So basically, there was a presentation where you are mentioning there was A band, B band, C band and then there was disburse loan and there was undisbursed loan. So, if a loan is getting A band in your scorecard, then why you were not disbursing the same and basically how this scorecard is coming up there.\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (1.0)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Anuj Pandey: So, the scorecard is primarily to predict probability of default, which is based on the financials and repayment behavior of the customer but many times a customer with good financial track record may not stacking works and eventually once enough data is there then we are able to increase our throughput much more in desirable segments basically GRO Score A and B.\n",

      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (1.0)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Anuj Pandey: So, our total restructured portfolio at the end of June is 120 crores, which is approximately 3.3% of the AUM and out of this 20% has become NPA. Rest 67% is current and 4% is in 30 to 90 bucket.\n",

      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (1.0)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Anuj Pandey: We can do that, so overall if you look at the total restructured portfolio by product then approximately 60% of that portfolio is under secured about 25% under unsecured and rest in supply chain and by sector about 85% of the portfolio is under education, hospitality, or light engineering. What we have seen in terms of repayment behavior. We are seeing that education and light engineering is back to normal at pre-pandemic levels. In hospitality though overall segment is now looking up but the stressed customers continue to be stressed and we had done an internal analysis in last quarter where we had predicted of how much more NPA can come in specially from the unsecured hospitality sector from our current restructured portfolio and we have planned for approximately 7-8 crores more NPA coming from there.\n",

      "Atul Prakash: Okay, just one more thing I wanted to understand we are going with such a high growth plan, and we are on the on the track to perform it, so there will be a capital adequacy ratio that you need to be maintaining. So, what are the strategies where we want to fix it on the capital adequacy ratio where we will be maintaining it.\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (1.0)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Shachindra Nath: So, I think so this has been answered multiple time. It is showcased in our presentation as well. I've said this in our previous answer, and I will try to summarize that. Regulatory we know we have to maintain a capital adequacy of 15%, which means at a leverage of 6 but we would like to ideally maintain our leverage of not more than 3.8 times you know maximum 3.5 times and by virtue of that with 35% of our business in off balance sheet we would be looking at raising this capital. Now raising this capital, you know the timing can be increased to 45% and leverage would remain the same. So, I think so we have this completely in our control and this does not worry us too much.\n",

      "Atul Prakash: One last query, see the market or the news is there that there will be some inflation will be striking in MSME sector specially will have some struggle during this period and we are corely into the MSME where we see our business going on that place.\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (0.986)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Shachindra Nath: So, sir, I think so SME and MSME is a very generalized term which is being used. I think so SME and MSME should be looked by you know the segment of the market in which one operate and now in the revised definition even a 200-crore company, a manufacturing company is also an SME. We service customer below 5-crore of turnover. Large focus of this company is to service the retail trade in within our define segment and most of our sector are domestic consumption driven economy. Our view is that domestic consumption driven economy the interest rate rise, and inflation would not mute the demand. One of the problems of controlling inflation in our country that you have to increase the supply side. Constraining demand doesn't help. So, within our customer set what we have seen till date neither the credit demand nor the cash flow is getting a stretch because we service very small businesses.\n",

They are as follows what will be co-spreading income as percent of total topline, example 3.2% has been taken in the example given on the last slide of the PPT. And second question is 18% target ROE by FY25. Will this revise further if you prioritize co-lending or plain vanilla lending?\n",

      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (1.0)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Nirav Shah: Yeah absolutely, so right now I think so basically the 10.5% that we are we are talking about includes the co-lending or you know the co-origination income that we see, the spread will be about 5.6% and the rest will be co-lending income in this quarter.\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (1.0)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Shachindra Nath: Next question on the ROE target 18%, obviously on a 20,000 crore or current, you know first it is very hard for listed companies to give projection for the year and for next 3 years. Now when you do that you do a most achievable targets and don't make blue sky assumptions while the ecosystem of co-lending is improving with every passing day when we made this prediction in 2021 there was a general skepticism marketplace model does not you know go well with when it comes to the lending as a business. All our banks and partners who are on the liability side want to see us as a principal lending partner so having in skin in the game having its own balance sheet helps and that's why we have made an estimate of half in half and half.\n",

      "Rhave Shah: Thank you next question is from the line of Mr. Manan Modi. With the transformation of U GRO to lending as a service model do you see the partnerships and alliances piece going down.\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (0.828)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Shachindra Nath: Answer is no. Our aspiration is that we create a bridge so on one side and partnership and alliance is one of our channels, it is a very good question. On one side we have a large ecosystem of small fintech, small NBFCs who otherwise can't get access to a large bank. So today on one side we are doing co-lending with them on the other side our originated asset we are doing co-lending with banks. Our constant endeavor is through our experience, our GRO Xstream platform and our ability, you know we would like to bring some of our large banks to become a direct co-lender to some of our partners, wherein we work as a bridge of providing technology, some form of credit enhancement and service. So, once one of such banks become a partner for our larger ecosystem, we think that over a period of time our P&A partners would benefit from the co-lenders which we were bringing on our platform.\n",

      "Rhave Shah: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Chet. Instead of declining customers who have less collateral can we opt for leading best practice to offer them smaller loans on different terms.\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (0.964)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Shachindra Nath: So, Amit and Anuj, I can answer. So, look I think so we don't differentiate the customer when we are assessing them. So, at that point of time our GRO score doesn't differentiate whether the customer is bringing a property as a collateral or machine as a collateral, or it is an unsecured loan it says yes or no and categories the customer in 5 different bands so to that extent theoretically we can offer the same customer an unsecured loan, but the issue is about affordability. The customer who wants to borrow against a collateral want a much longer tenure loan because that fits in their cash flow and want a lower yield. So, a customer who is coming for a secured loan would not be satisfied with a very small unsecured loan and from a risk perspective we offer up to 3 crores in secured but we offer only up to 25,00,000 lakhs in unsecured loan. Amit, you want to add something that.\n",

      "Rhave Shah: Thank you. The next question is how many micro branches we plan to open this year. How is the performance of the branches launched last year in terms of productivity and payback period? have a 12-month breakeven plan for each of these branches. By end of this quarter, the first set of branches have broken even. We will see all these branches at a break even and delivering high profitability by December. Once proven, so while the first few branches have proven that they can be profitable in the first 12 months of launching and so once proven I think we will look at the next stage of expansion, depending upon how these branches behave and how early they breakeven. We will look at anywhere between 25 to 50 branches by this yearend possibly in the quarter 4.\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (0.899)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Shachindra Nath: And overall, in our 2025 plan in our identified 5 state Telangana. Tamil Nadu, Karnataka. Rajasthan, and Gujarat. We have done massive data and tricks of roughly around 3000 plus pin code and this is a cluster approach, and we believe that there are 280 clusters in these 5 states where we would eventually like to be present purely from opportunity and credit quality perspective.\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (1.0)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Rhave Shah: Thank you. The next question is co-lending is a space for banks who have good cash and co-lender has good presence in areas where the bank is not present, but with U GRO we have very few touchpoints how can we benefit the most among competitors?\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (0.714)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Shachindra Nath: So, I think it is not a question of, it is not necessary only physical touchpoint which matters. Over a period, our touchpoint would also increase but our origination and sourcing engine is multi force. So, while our physical branch footprint in the top 25 location and what we call prime customer contribute 40 %to 50% of India's MSME credit outstanding within these 25 locations. So, you can get as much volume as you want within that 25 location. Our current 70 location they are the first prominent point of credit origination purely from a corresponding cluster perspective and that would continue to grow. Third we have machinery financing business which does not necessarily require every point physical presence because our source of origination is our OEM partners today there are roughly around 180 OEMs in India. We are live with many of them, and it is increasing and as that increases you know customer origination keep increasing. Our supply chain financing business again is you know as you continue to increase the number of anchors the distribution channel the distributor, the retailer they can be anywhere but the entire collection engine for that is driven digitally you know that also will go in co-lending, our P&A channel service is almost you know the entire universe of you know India and their collection and infrastructure is being serviced by our partner and we know whenever merchant financing platform would go live you know you can be anywhere and we would be able to finance that would also go with co-lending. So I don't think so that physical presence is any constraint. Our digital infrastructure, our partner‚Äôs infrastructure is what drive and propel our co- lending partnership and as well as our own balance sheet.\n",

Today, we are seeing healthy growth across all geographies. In certain sectors owing to pandemic, we had deliberately slowed down but for other sectors and across all geographies we are seeing a very-very healthy growth.

People look at multiple number of NBFCs, I keep hearing this question what is the co-differentiation. We are trying to explain that differentiation and I think so we are gradually making the breakout of how multiple platforms in the West has benefited and how our customer can benefit from that. From day one, while we have never done formal IPO but we started as a listed company, raised all our capital in that, in hope that the broader public market would appreciate the business model because one of the things which is very unique that when we look at our peers set who are not listed most of the investors who are putting in capital is in very threshold and eventually they come to the public market in most of the public market investors are buying them very- very expensive versus we think that we showcase an opportunity to public market investor to benefit like a private equity investor of benefiting from our growth quality of business and huge infrastructure both digital technological and also people infrastructure which we have built.

So, without further delay, I would now like to hand over the floor to the management for their opening comments. Thank you and over to sirs.\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (0.984)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Shachindra Nath: Good afternoon. Thank you ICICI Securities for hosting us. As a matter of information as of yesterday in our last board meeting uh we have appointed Mr. Satyanand Mishra as Non-Executive Chairman of our board and I have taken the redesignation as vice chairman and managing director. We did that because at the scale at which we are operating now and the scale which we would like to achieve it is our considered view that the financial institution, the board governance should be headed by an independent director, as you would all have seen that majority of large financial institutions, the board chairmanship is in the hands of independent directors. This is what regulators also expect us all of you know SEBI has come up with an advisory of voluntary acceptance of the segregation of the post of managing director and the chairman and we have done that much prior to when it becomes a regulatory obligation. So, in that context actually we are completing third year of our full operation. It has been a journey which has been both rewarding and also of great learning. In July 2018 when we raised significant amount of capital, the aspiration was to build UGRO as India's largest financial institution solving the problem of credit for small businesses. This problem has been in existence for many numbers of decades. Large number of lending institutions have been trying to solve for this problem. With every passing year the credit gap has been increasing, while the contribution of MSME‚Äôs to the GDP of India is increasing but the simultaneous offtake of credit for SME has been a challenge and our view was that within the lending institution outside the bank there is an opportunity to use deep specialization and data analytics and combined with technology can gradually solve the problem of credit. When we started, obviously some of our embedded thinking we thought that we have to first use it, test it, implement it, and be successful and then we will bring it at forefront to public market for them to understand what we have done and delivered. There are many numbers of players in the market who actually start with the promise of what the data analytics and technology can do. We have taken the conservative route of first anguishing ourselves, build portfolio, prove through our portfolio performance what data analytics can do. We generally believe that the future of credit for small businesses in India is a function of how data can be used to disseminate the credit. Now it is actually proven that the entire SME credit industry, the ecosystem of data is going to power the credit. Historically when it used to come to SME it was genuinely believed within the lending fraternity that this is a segment of the market wherein the information flow is very poor. The formal to informal economy gap is very high and the credit decisioning can only be done with their physical with every passing day, and this is happening because the three core layers of credit, which is the identity layer, the payment layer and the data layer is all maturing at a rapid pace. Once the OCEN gets fully implemented and ONDC also get implemented we can see that the future generation of lenders would be able to do give the credit decisioning purely on the basis of data and that would evolve into all the three form of credit, embedded credit, flow-based credit, and buy now pay later kind of credit. This is also a function of what you know we have many numbers of fintechs their payment platforms have been growing. There is large amount of VC funding coming for that. We differentiate ourselves or we differentiate between tech and data. Our view is that data is more powerful and actually within the lending universe the uses of data is very less. Use of technology has become prominent and sometimes we combine and understand the tech is the data but that's not true. Data is your ability to look at information, analyze and use it for decisioning, monitoring, and future performance; where tech is enabling the process flow and that's why we say at completion of three years we are presenting UGRO as powered by data and tech what does data do for us is very unique. We have an underwriting scorecard, which is an effort of last four years of deep data analytics platform which we have built. Now which is called Version 2. This is our machine learning algorithm platform which provide the decisioning through a rule engine and faster roll out of credit and you know find the different kind of customer and risk rank them. Our data also helps in origination which in finding new location. you know mapping our sales forces, tracking them and you know making sure that they reach the right target. Our technology platform provides the efficiency which means that at every point credit industry in India is highly manual and physical. Obviously, we use our physical footprint to do the last mile work in distribution and also support collection but the intermediation from the point of origination to decisioning is largely digitized through our tech platform and also we are using data plus technology across our operation and collection and last but not least we have seen within the lending universe, the use of data for early warning signals and future portfolio performance is not extensively used but we believe that with the advent of deep bureau footprint multiplicity of information flow coming from different open sources can also provide for deep insight of how the customer would behave in future and that's why we are here to present and say UGRO has in the last three years evolved as a data tech company since its inception. So, you know as I said we have our Chief Risk Officer, Anuj and we have Subrata, our Chief Innovation Officer. Last four and a half years they have spent 24x7 their time in thinking through and designing this. So, I would leave this into good hands of both Anuj and Subrata to tell what is this data driven proprietary score model and why this becomes core to us when it comes to decisioning of credit.\n",

So typically, as one understands lending is primarily based on the prior repayment behavior of the customer and what we were trying to do which we think is the right way to underwrite a learning platform what we have done with our proprietary scoring model is to combine these two elements. So, our GRO Score today is a combination of the repayment behavior score of the customer and over that the banking behavior score of the customer. Typically, you can see on the screen, and this has come after a lot of rigorous analysis of more than 25,000 parameters which can be seen and extracted from a normal bank statement and a bureau track record of the customer. We have customized that to our target segment, and this is the innovation which in this kind of scale and with this kind of execution almost no one has attempted in India before. This has given us a lot of directional sense and a window because this goes hand-in-hand with the way data ecosystem is getting evolved across the SME businesses in India. So today when a customer applies to us, all we ask is his GST number, GST statement, and his bank statement along with the KYC documents and post that the system takes over and it goes into very deep and extracts various kinds of parameters for example the borrowing mix, the frequency and magnitude of defaults, history of high cost debt, obligation as a percentage of turnover, etc. which have all been customized to our kind of target segment and this has been back tested and is administered in real time. So, in terms of giving a credit decisioning to the customer we are right on the cutting edge. So just to you know uh show you all the glimpse of what we have already evidenced through the initial administration of our score typically our scorecard categorizes the customer into five bands: ‚ÄúA‚Äù, ‚ÄúB‚Äù, ‚ÄúC‚Äù, ‚ÄúD‚Äù, ‚ÄúE‚Äù. ‚ÄúA‚Äù being the least risky and ‚ÄúE‚Äù being the most risky. And already in our analysis for the customers whom we have given loan and on customers who we haven't given loan we have applied our scorecard and we have found that this risk ranks beautifully. So scoreband ‚ÄúA‚Äù customer has negligible default rate and a scoreband ‚ÄúE‚Äù customer has relatively higher default rate. So, depending on the kind of customers we have, we now have a template, which of course we are using but eventually the thought process is that it can democratize SME lending in the country. Just to you know reiterate when we started, we said that we want to focus on eight sectors within the SME industry we added a ninth sector called micro enterprises for very small loans. We continue to build more momentum and gain more insights in these sectors. So, whatever statistical work we have done sits on top of our sector selection. This the idea is eventually to have operational, and facility related insights also from customers depending on which sector or sub sector they belong to and make a policy and underwriting very easy for them.\n",

      "Amit Mande: Let me take this Sachin. Having said that the data and our Gro Score is at heart of our ability to decision customers and moving towards complete database underwriting. I think that is also at heart of our entire tech platform and at the center of the slide you will all see Gro Protect which is our rule engine which houses this decision engine and data power that is the fundamental to all our tech platforms that support business. To this core there are multiple connected multiple platforms, our Gro Plus is a platform that powers our prime branches. I will come to that distribution later, but our prime branch is essentially the large ticket products. Our Gro Direct is what we have built to go direct to the customer again, derives its which is the supply chain business, is powered by our platform called Gro Chain which not only does the supplier side of the business but also the buyer side of the dealer side of the business and that's also again powered by Gro Protect and finally our partnership and alliances where we harness multiple ecosystems is the fourth platform. So, our entire full suite SME lending platform as we call it from the intermediary distribution to direct distribution to our supply chain and partnerships are all built around this one single thought process of being able to underwrite the SME and MSME on basis of data tripod, the GST, banking and the bureau which rests inside our Gro Protect engine and of course it's supported by our data lake. So, what exactly are these platforms powering. The Gro plus powers our prime business as we call it or the prime branch business, where we do large tickets secured loans, the unsecured loans and also our entire micro business. We are now 75 branches on micro across the country in five states and growing at a very rapid pace and we've tasted initial success on the high yield secure product here and we believe that this will be our growth engine. Our ecosystem business essentially the supply chain and the machinery business which is fundamentally runs on the ecosystems of 45 anchors in supply chain and about 30 OEMS in the machinery finance business again works on the Gro Chain platform. We continue to harness multiple ecosystems to reach to the last mile of the MSME with multiple partnerships essentially co-lending and fintech partnerships. We found this is a very rewarding business where we, our partners together in collaboration are able to reach the last mile and provide them with credit. Fundamentally Gro Direct powers our digital platform where we go direct to the customers. Fundamentally, all this distribution is built on our tech platforms which then again go back to the core of our Gro Protect engine which is our tripod of underwriting.\n",

      "Amit Mande: Sure. What has also been essentially our driving force of our growth has been our partnerships on the other side with the large banks and the NBFCs. This has been our liability engine and we've been able to. We have this unique advantage and leadership position in being able to have multiple relationships across all the large PSU banks for our co-lending business right from whether it's been Bank of Baroda, Central Bank of India, State bank of India, IDBI and another about seven banks in pipeline. These will continue to fuel our growth ambition by providing us the necessary liability through co-lending. If one were to look at how successful we have been with Co-lending then, yes, we did take time initially but now 16% of our book in quarter four of last year did come from the co-lending business and the co-origination business. As we go forward this will be our essential pillar of growth and by next year end, we will look at about 35% of our business off-book through these partnerships.\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (0.983)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Shachindra Nath: I must add this, our view is that the NBFC or the fintech lending is systematically changing in India. Conventionally most of the lending institution have succeeded in leveraging their balance sheet from five asset tenor and then creating some type of asset liability mismatch, but that era is receding. I think so the systematically financial institutions in India and globally would like to use our power of data analytics technology and asset origination and use us as an intermediation partner and that's why those who would succeed in creating a marketplace kind of platform which is co-lending would have both very high profitable growth and liability would not remain a constraint or concern and I think directionally we are very strong on that. The return reward ratio, if you were to lever your balance sheet only three times or four times and you have to earn the same margin to get to a double digit return on equity is very challenging but in our model which we will show you I think this becomes a reality very-very quickly. One of the things which we have been hearing in last three years. We are little odd the way we started our business. Most of the businesses in lending industry would start as a private company, would build under a private umbrella, and then once they mature then they will go to public and raise capital at a significant premium to their equity base. Our view was that good companies like ours which are providing a growth opportunity should start as a listed company. In US we have seen multiple SPAC getting very successful wherein they start with a blank capital and then build business around us. We did the same. In 2018, we took over a very small listed NBFC, we raised significant amount of capital and we expected the capital market to benefit from the growth momentum which we are building. But sometimes in the marketplace we are compared to legacy or very established 10-year, 15-year, 20-year-old organization. All of our peers which are still private to get the benefit of high multiple or very high value realization because private investors can see what would happen in future and they provide a value to that and this is our effort to give public market the visibility because a lot of people who have heard this question that we understand what you guys are building, when we compare it to legacy or establish player your return matrix looks very muted but obviously there is a heavy amount of investment and capitalization which has happened and that's why first last year we gave our 2025 guidance and we felt that would be sufficient but we now think that given the level of transparency which we provide to all our public shareholders we have given the bridge of how we would move year on year and we are hopeful that you know this would help you in understanding our company. So, if you look at AUM rise of FY22 we have an AUM of 2969 crore. We are targeting as of FY23 an AUM of 7000 odd crores. We had an off-book asset under management of 16% and that we are increasing 35%, we would like it to even go further but this is our conservative estimate. We think that our yield band would remain in the 14.3% to 14.5%. Please remember that UGRO operate across the yield band in its product portfolio. We do a highly secured business starting at 9% yield versus you know business loan segment at 18% yield and we create a healthy mix so that our portfolio quality remain stable and we are not only in high yield businesses and that gives sustainability. We have taken a conservative view in terms of our cost of borrowing. We believe that the lending market, the institutional bank lending market is highly gravitated because financial institutions are still suffering from the impacts of IL&FS and then pandemic and that's why it's not natural to lend independent company and cost of borrowing to come down. There are set of 5 or 10 NBFC, which have deep parentage and that's why they have the cost of borrowing advantage and that's why we think it would come down as we mature but we have projected to remain in the same cost of borrowing band and same net interest margin. Our portfolio are seeing given the heavy investment which we have already done and now the output into the business is coming and we have multiple co-lending partnerships which gives both on balance sheet borrowing and off balance sheet borrowing, we are seeing that our written on asset should move from 0.6 of FY22 to 2% and then the target of 4.5% by 2025 and our ROEs would also you know improve from 1.5 to 6%- 8%. This ROE could have been better but we are also our given our initial period years, we are still keeping our leverage below 3.0x so there is a capital infusion also planned that is depressing our ROE but we will see if we continue to grow the way we are growing and if the capital comes at a later part of the year so ROE would be much higher.\n",

      "Anuj Pandey: I'll quickly take you through the snapshot of our portfolio as of March 2022. So, you'll see that across products, across geographies, across the sectors which we have it is pretty well diversified. We started with 9 branches of our prime loans in 2018 and later on we have expanded now close to 20 branches in prime loans and close to 75 branches exclusively catering to micro SMES. So now we are well established across pan India. Our original 8 sectors are pretty well distributed. The light engineering sector we are seeing a lot of positive movement thanks to manufacturing buoyancy, which we are seeing in the last two quarters. We think that will continue for some time across our product categories. The prime loans are the largest currently accounting for 54% of the total portfolio. As we go forward, we don't see much change in the overall mix across sectors or geography will continue to remain well diversified. Overall collection efficiency trend over the year it has improved every quarter last year as we moved forward and now has stabilized at around 94% percent at ending March 22. Out of our total portfolio, 96.4% of the portfolio is in stage 1. Our total restructuring owing to COVID was about 136 crores, which is 4.6% of our AUM as of March 22. Within that restructured portfolio maximum amount of restructuring was done for schools, for hospitality business, and for light engineering and we are already seeing a lot of green shoots coming education and light engineering sectors are back. Hospitality continues to be a little sluggish, but we expect that in next one or two quarters it will again be back. Our end gross NPA number as of March 2022 is 2.3% and this includes if you recall RBI had come out with a circular in November of 2021 on reclassification of assets and we have adopted that fully. Although RBI had given more time to NBFCs till September 2022. We have decided that we will continue to remain adopted.\n",

It is from our channels which is prime wherein we do prime secured customer, we have micro enterprises where there is a big thrust and focus.

      "Gaurav Agarwal: Right. So, when do we see like the metrices that you mentioned in the listed markets and investor interest coming in I mean what is the kind of threshold that you plan to achieve? market our peerset private investors especially the investors are providing very high multiple you know for similar set of performance rather than lower performances. I think so at this point of time our view is that the public market is overweighted by what you know is right now being not being able to provide the premium or being able to give any kind of momentum or a growth of for growth-oriented companies. So, majority of the lenders who are listed have three sets of the problem. Problem of growth and problem of legacy portfolio and wherein the credit performance is unknown and that worries public market investors because they are not sure of what would be the real balance sheet versus you know we have crossed that hurdle and we are growing so given our lower base and from that base we are growing at this speed I think so we would be much more valuable and we are hopeful that some of you would recognize that and find it attractive.\n",

I have a few questions on the proof of concept as well as the QIP, so I just going to tell you them one by one. So, on the proof-of-concept banks in the west for example when they've implemented machine learning models, they've complained about how they have to keep updating the set of rules that go into this model to stay on top of you know customer behavior. So, for our model how often do we need to keep on top of this and how often do you update the grow metrics with your data set?\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (0.992)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Shachindra Nath: Yeah, thanks Chinmay, very-very good question. So, we have Subrata who is our chief innovation officer and our entire data analytics team have been working tirelessly for the last four years. Subrata this is something for you.\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (0.884)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Subrata Das: Thank you Sachin. Thanks for the question, Chinmay. So, we are well placed to monitor and govern the performance of the scorecard as for very well-defined structured framework. Through our experienced scorecards such as these in our market have been seen to hold their level of performance for anywhere between 12 to 24 months or more if you're lucky but given the nature of the diversity of the underlying customer segment if you need to tune them faster than that then we are in a very good position to do that but as of now the scorecards are holding the early indicators that are very encouraging and we have refinement we are able to do that, yeah.\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (0.998)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Shachindra Nath: And Chinmay if I may add that majority of the scorecard which are in existence in Indian market including the consumer financing segment are largely bureau dependent. So, bureau has lot of data and people do you know added work on what they get from the bureau but when it comes to small business a bureau cut off or bureau behavior may not necessarily be able to predict the cash flow analysis and the future behavior and what would be the future profile of the business. What we have found is unique and that's what we are saying the transformation which is happening into the SME market in India that both GST which gives you the turnover data and 400 parameters around turnover and digitized banking can do three things. The intent of the customer, the eligibility and the ability to pay. So all three and bureau is behavioral in analysis and that's why it is very unique. So today for roughly around 350+ or 400 crore of monthly disbursement UGRO doesn't ask anyone a balance sheet or an income tax return or profit and loss statement and you'll be amazed to know that the top 10 lenders in the country including the largest of them the State Bank of India and Bank of Baroda and likes have accepted that because they have seen the result of that because at a 6 month or 10 month or a 12 month old balance sheet led financial statement is not the true representation of what is the you know ability and eligibility of the customer.\n",

      "Chinmay Bhargava: Okay. Thank you for the wonderful insights on that. If I could ask two quick questions as well. On the next slide could you please explain why we disperse at all to score band D and E customers, like why not just focus on A, B, and C.\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (0.996)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Anuj Pandey: So, I'll answer that. So, it is also a function of the kind of product you are doing so if you see our Gro Score is a predictor of probability of default but there is other element of loss given a default in case of a secured loan and lot of times one can draw little comfort. So, in the spirit of testing the scorecard in terms of risk rank through our live portfolio and also taking into account the loss given default parameter we have done some disbursals but in unsecured loan where there is no security, we don't do disbursals in Gro Score D and E.\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (0.999)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Chinmay Bhargava: Am I right in assuming that D and E would also have higher yield loans and the data point to the right suggests that A and B have the highest disbursals and you disburse lower amounts to D and E.\n",

      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (1.0)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Shachindra Nath: Yeah, So I think so the QIP resolution if you're looking at that outcome our QIP resolution is an enabling resolution as you know that every year when you go to the shareholders you know keep an enabling resolution and depending upon how the market performs and there is an opportunity you do that. You know I think so where we are trading right now, and at that level this would lead to a significant dilution and that's why you know we would raise capital that's our endeavor because the kind of growth which we have to get you know capital is a necessity but the timing, the form, and the kind of investor we are yet to decide. So, I think by next quarter when we will come and meet up with you, we'll give you much more concrete answers to this question. This is not necessarily you should take that QIP resolution means that we are going to do a QIP itself.\n",

      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (1.0)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Anil Tulsiram: Yeah, thank you for the opportunity. My first question is on your Grow Micro loan. So I want to understand like what is the customer profile here, so is it like someone who has a credit score or a new credit customer or how is it and also any of your scoring model is helpful here so basically I am trying to understand how our business model is different to five star because I think five star is mostly into five to seven like ticket sizes but mostly into the secured loan and I think if I am right we are into unsecured loans for the Gro micro. Shachindra Nath : I would get both Anuj and Amit to answer but I'll just give you, since you have taken name one name, I will give you one input. First and foremost, I think around six months back there was a change wherein the retail trade industry in India has been classified as MSME. The unique proposition only for priority sector loan purposes. The one unique proposition means that the entire bank financing which requires the 40% to be priority sector and of that 7.5% has to be MSME retail trade industry, which means in a small town a shopkeeper is MSME for priority sector so that's why the opportunity set is very unique. Number two, with most of our peers set which do that business including the Five Star from because that is the only segment of the market which they operate, they largely are in the loan banks sub 7 lakhs or 8 lakh rupees. Given that we are you know large and diversified player we have scores, we have data analytics prowess technology and distribution and we also do secured loan up to three crores. Our ability us and that's why in our micro enterprises channel we don't do lows up to 25-lakh secured and gradually you know we have a product which is 75 lakh to 1 crore in our prime branches will be also rolled out in our micro enterprises resulting into a faster break even and much larger volume of business. Anuj and Amit! type of customer and credit profile if you want to take that.\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (0.732)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Anuj Pandey: Yeah, so I'll quickly just add, so we don't do new to credit customers. So primary eligibility of customer is that he should have some kind of credit records although it might be very thin and because the profile of the customer the banking and credit history might be very thin. So the efficacy of applying his scorecard at this point of time is relatively lower but we are working on that but alternatively what we have done is we have applied a lot of analytics in selecting the geography from which we want to source these loans and hence we have done a pin code wise analysis across all the states and we have picked depending on the future portfolio performance size of the market in which the kind of pin code we want to do business with.\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (0.997)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Anil Tulsiram: Got it and I have just one more question and it's a very broad question. See we have been repeating our target of reaching 20000-crore by 2025 for which it's obvious that we need to grow at a higher growth rate. So, I think we will face three challenges in this. First maintaining the corporate culture, second hiring the right set of people and giving enough incentive for the people to stay us for a longer period of time, and third maintaining the credit culture. So, any thoughts on these three aspects. Shachindra Nath : I will try quickly responding to that. First is the corporate culture, I think so UGRO has a culture, you know this is an institution wherein the ownership is institutional, supervision and governance is by an independent board and we would like to have people who think of this as a long-term home for themselves. Now having said that the culture which we have to instill and install of a culture of ownership because you know that we have a 5.88% of equity ownership of this company is in the hands of the management. We would like that ownership to go up and like we have seen many other institutions likes of HDFC and ICICI wherein people joined the institution and benefited by creating shareholders value. This institute there UGRO also give people the same opportunity. Second is about maintaining the credit culture. I think so our credit culture is maintained by our data. Because our credit is controlled by what our data sees and there is nothing beyond that. We are into highly granularized templated data decision loan business and that's why and strategically we have to only think of the segment of the market and what could be the potential loss ratio. I think so we are in a very good place where we have achieved in three years‚Äô time and pandemic has proven that all of our model is working. I missed, what is the third question.\n",

First and foremost, I think that this room and the sets of people who are sitting over here, they are co-owners of this business they are incentivized by long- term shareholder value creation, and they are benefiting from that and also their next level. Second, we try to see our business as a niche business where it's broken in multiple pieces and parts in each part being run by a strong leader who is responsible for its own P&L and once, he performs for the P&L it benefits. You'll be amazed to know that right up to our L3 levels and the business head and the credit people they are incentivized for their particular vertical delivery and that is also one of the reason people like to come and work for us because they think as if they are quasi-CEOs for their respective businesses. And when you go to the bottom of the pyramid wherein your compensation or the fixed cost is low you incentivize people by providing them shorter term variable structure so that what they do in the near term is what they get paid for so we are building the hybrid culture of equity based ownership for senior management, variable pay basis structure on P&L performance and you know monthly and quarterly incentive plans for the sales and you know collection forces.\n",

First of all, going through the quarter-on-quarter performance I observed that the AUM growth is falling down every quarter for example in September from June to September the growth was 45%, from September to December the growth was 30% and from December to March the growth has come to 15%. So could you please give any reason why there is a fall in growth of AUM.\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (0.979)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Anuj Pandey: So, when you compare AUM you also should consider the base effect. In each quarter the base has grown a lot. So cumulatively if you see on a year-to-year basis you will see a very high growth but when you compare quarter-to-quarter obviously the growth would be somewhat muted.\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (0.999)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Shachindra Nath: We started in you know predominantly in April 19 as our first full year. So that was 850 crore of total asset under management. In FY21, we were roughly around 1300 crore, FY22 we are roughly around 3,000 odd crore. I think so we are growing.\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (0.814)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Amit Gupta: On a year-on-year basis we have actually grown 127% and what you were actually talking about that was quarter on quarter sequential growth. So, in that way if you actually want to see the first quarter, we had actually started doing disbursement only in the end of June. So, in that quarter our aum growth would have been by 150 crores only. So, in that between quarter one and quarter two we would have grown the highest but over a period of times after our business engine started kicking on you would obviously on a sequential basis you would not see that kind of a growth.\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (0.987)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Manish Agarwal: Okay. Thank you, sir. So, and what was the disbursement? The disbursement has fallen in this quarter. Like last quarter we had a disbursement of around 1050 crore, and it has come down to 960 crores so what could be the reason behind the falling disbursement.\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (1.0)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Shachindra Nath: Two reasons sir. First and foremost, as you know as soon as we ended the month of December the fourth wave of COVID came in. That disrupted the first 20 days of business while it receded very fast, but it was unknown to us that what would be this expansion and how far it would hit. As a lending institution obviously, you go in a contraction mode very quickly when you see that is happening and then you restart that business. So, our first month of January was a complete wash and by the time we restarted re-assess it was mid of Feb. So actually, in the Q4 we had roughly around 45 days to 50 days of operating threshold. Second also as you know that we are a business wherein on one side of this business you have liability engine which is banks and financial institution who give us the money and other side we lend the money to customers through our different channel. Most of the banks and financial institution also because of the fourth round of pandemic was slower in giving disbursement to us for us to onward lend and you know this is you would, I must tell that you please expect some volatility on you know quarter-on-quarter because depending upon where you know we are also impacted by macroeconomic and you know financial institutions response to us in terms of giving money is dependent upon that not necessarily related to us but you know as a constitutive strategy that's why we are heavily focused on off balance sheeting and partnership with partners who can do co-lending and also co-origination so that we have uniformity in our disbursement engine.\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (0.547)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Manish Agarwal: Thank you sir, so one question is on regarding co-lending sir. In co-lending we have a percentage of 80- 20 if I remember so if the 20 percent which we are saying is there any waterfall mechanism in that.\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (1.0)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Shachindra Nath: So, sir there are two types. So, when the co-lending which is under the RBI circular of 2020 it is at Pari- Passu level and there is no waterfall mechanism. The risk and rewards are shared in Pari-Passu nature. We have now also entered into some co-origination partnership with some of the large NBFCs and also we have done as you might see in the slide one BC arrangement with a small finance bank those have waterfall mechanism but most of them when you see our balance sheet they are disclosed but most of them are within our tolerance band of credit cost which we expect and they are fully provisioned for in terms of what we expect to come from there.\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (1.0)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Manish Agarwal: Okay, so going forward what can we expect like more contracts will be in waterfall mechanism or will be Pari-Passu?\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (1.0)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Shachindra Nath: Our expectation is, Amit you have that number how much of that is?\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (1.0)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Amit Gupta: It would be around 50-50. Because when we are actually talking about our AOP plan, the co-lending and co-origination, I am actually saying co-origination there we would probably be providing some kind of trade enhancement. Co-lending mostly would be with the bank. So, the numbers are actually similar in next year. So, 50-50 you can assume on a rough basis.\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (1.0)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Amit Mande: By next year end, 37% of our portfolio will be off book 36.5% out of which about 16% is in co-lending, 11% to 12% is in co-origination and the rest is on direct assignment. So, co-lending still forms the higher percentage of the off book, co-origination will be just about near double digits.\n",

      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (1.0)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Rushad Kapadia: Sure, we have questions from Pramod Jain. So, the first question is does UGRO have any mechanism of forecasting sectoral scenarios to realign its lending policy and avoid NPAs and sectors undergoing downtrend cycle?\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (1.0)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Shachindra Nath: Anuj?\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (1.0)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Anuj Pandey: Yeah, we do that. So, we have a partnership with Crisil, and we keep getting macroeconomic indicators from them and also because the distribution and the portfolio is sector focused, the portfolio performance of our own is also a good early warning signal in case something is going wrong. Just to give you one example pre-pandemic we had started seeing slowdown of auto component sector and we had proactively slowed down our own distribution and as a result of that our auto component sectors portfolio performance as of today is amongst the best in the industry, so both are a constant monitoring of our own portfolio and our quarterly updates on the macroeconomic indicators across the sectors in which we are. These are the twin mechanisms which we follow.\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (0.617)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Rushad Kapadia: Thank you. Next question from Pramod himself is very few NBFCs have withstood and survived the entire cycle so how does UGRO cushion itself and assure investors of its long-term survival and growth? outline performance in capital market vis-a-vis banks if you look at set of broad banks public sector, private sector except three private sector banks majority of the combination of public and private sector bank and now even SFBs vis-a-vis the NBFC as a sector, NBFC have outperformed the banking as a sector. Number two there are at least of the top 10 listed companies at least 7 of them have been in existence for more than three decades and you know so you have you know the likes of Chola, Sundaram, Mahindra finance independent company like Muthoot, Manapuram, they have all succeeded survived and grown over a very long period of time and actually if you look at those who had either a deep specialization into a segment of the market or have the ability to underwrite a customer on unique set of information or underwriting criteria have actually provided much better performance. The uniqueness and that's what regulator and the policy maker also recognize the bank model is a broad base model and their ability to go to a deeply specialized underserved segment is what NBFCs do and when now that's why this whole approach of collaboration. Banks are custodial of the liability side; they get money from saving and retail investors to hold the money NBFC are unique in set of being able to find and serve the market which are not being served and that's why they should collaborate. So I think generally if you look at either so don't look at the wrong examples of you know companies which have been in the real-estate, wholesale credit, have been done with a very short-term approach obviously they would not survive but those who are in segment of the market which is either retail or SME or consumer and have an ability to design it little longer time horizon would definitely be able to succeed and survive and this is not a phenomenon just in India it is a phenomenon globally.\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (0.993)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Rushad Kapadia: The third and final question from Pramod is, is it correct to say that UGRO‚Äôs main business will always be a zero-sum game as UGRO‚Äôs borrowing costs shall always be far higher than its peers and therefore cross selling or company lending is the only space where the company is going to make its profits?\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (0.999)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Shachindra Nath: Again I would say that please look at go back in decades history, I think so if you're comparing NBFC to NBFC peer cost as the business mature the cost of borrowing keep coming down very dramatically, please go and look at a bank like you know AU which was an NBFC look 10 years back look at their starting cost of borrowing and as they matured it came down dramatically so with vintage your cost of borrowings keep coming down. For us actually our cost of borrowing is going down at an accelerated pace because why on the face of it you may see that our average cost of borrowing is 10.5% but when we you know originate asset with a borrowing of 10.5%, we are down selling that asset into co-lending anything between a 7% to 8.5%. So actually, we have the same pricing advantage which a large bank have because that large bank's money is coming to us and as we mature our cost of borrowing, and you know which keep coming down and third and most we operate in the segment of the market which otherwise mainline lenders have found it difficult. On the face of it actually they should also be able to do it. I think somebody on the call you know ask about a five-star credit which is a micro lender for very small MSME, and they have shown an outlier performance. Theoretically all banks should be able to do it but banks have many other things to do it simultaneously and that's why to build that deep focus and being able to find this is not a business wherein the cost of borrowing matters it is a business wherein your cost of lending matters and NBFCs generally have a cost of lending which will be higher than what banks can get uh or mainline large NBFCs can get and we are in that play.\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (0.979)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Rushad Kapadia: Thank you we have the next question from Tejas. He has asked in the last con-call a monthly disbursal target of 600-crore was provided and what caused us to fall short of that and what would be the month- on-month disbursal expectations going forward.\n",
      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (0.894)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Shachindra Nath: Yeah, so we have talked about the capacity. Our distribution is set for a capacity of roughly around 600 to 700 crores. Now of that what capacity we are utilizing is a function of three things. What can we get on balance sheet borrowing? How much of funnel is getting created out of our co-origination and co- lending? And what is our risk appetite given the broader macro scenario? Right, so our capacity and our disbursement are a calibration of all three. So, as you see that we have done you know 1080-crore of disbursement in Q3 it came down because all three were falling short. The market was still volatile, pandemic was about to hit big time and you know this is a sector which get affected very-very quickly. So, we calibrated it down but what we have provided you is a very clear guidance of what we will be doing. So, we said we had touched just 3000 crores, our AUM would go 7000 crore, of that AUM what would come on our balance sheet, what would be off-balance sheet is all provided and please be guided by that. I must still say the disclaimer is most of the companies don't stick their neck out and give this kind of yearly guidance. We have provided that so that the early stage some of the investors can really understand how we are growing but obviously it is subject to all the macro factors how the liability market is functioning what is happening in the macro, and you know hopefully the COVID is not a concern anymore.

      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Amit Mande: So rightly put three factors that define our growth, and they are essentially the ones that feed the distribution and the asset growth, but the asset growth engine has really been cranked up, as Sachin said to about a 550 to a 600 crore a month kind of disbursals. This quarter as guided we should look at a 1000+ crores of disbursal and it will keep growing to touch our 7000 crore AUM by March end.\n",

      "‚Üí Sentiments: Neutral (0.979)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Shachindra Nath: So, as you might have seen in some of our previous quarters, we have said that for most of our incremental expense was coming in our branch expansion, we have a target to grow to 280 + location in five of the identified states where we think there is the highest degree of opportunity and we have been because we have realized that we have to simultaneously we have to invest into our business for long term growth but we have to simultaneously prove to all of our shareholders that what we have invested also represent, so that we have taken a pause on first two quarters of any further branch expansion and you know that's why you are seeing if you look at our FY23 guidance it tells you the guidance that our expenses are fully baked in and now we are focusing on growth and bottom line creations and that's why our income to Opex ratio is coming down from 73% to roughly around 63 odd %.\n",

      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Shachindra Nath: Very good question, thank you so much. So, I think yes, if you look at our source of financing mix obviously, we divide term financing on our balance sheet, co-lending, and co-origination and securitization of asset. Within the term financing we pride ourselves being able to attract all sources of financing most of the public sector banks are lender to us but within them also as you know RBI has a framework of you know onward lending which qualifies the priority sector. We take money from public sector banks in that. We take money from private sector banks, we take money from capital market, and we also have started taking money from most of the multilateral and DFIs. Actually, we have done the first trade with ResponsAbility and now we are in discussion with many of them. And that is also happening, and I think so on 3rd of June our impact financing report would go public. We have analyzed serious impacts on different SDG goals which we are creating through our network and that's why we have an ability to do what we call specialized directed financing. As you know most of the multilaterals DFI's and impact fund would like to provide capital for some form of a directed financing so which cannot sure be WASH financing which can be clean energy financing, which can be on women empowerment financing. UGRO actually represent a unique opportunity wherein once we analyze top 45 lending institutions within the multilateral and DFI's world at least 80% to 90% of their mandate get covered within the UGRO network framework and that's why we have roughly around uh $75 million to $100 million target this year within the DFI community itself.\n",

My job is primarily to give an introduction about the company. The company as of this quarter has a standing of almost 35 years. The company is founded by Sri G. Radhakrishna, present Managing Director and it started in a small way. We have come to this level and become a company on 1st April 2005. In 2017 we have got listed company in emerging platform of NSE. Now in the last year December we have migrated to the main board. The company has started its business with various construction activities, small to big and finally now we have been now concentrating on our core competent areas of marine structures and bridges where we have already made our footprint. Even though we are a midcap we have got our place in this segment where we are. We have been ranked as one of the top 10 companies for designing and executing marine works in the country. The company has been executing on-shore and infrastructure project in (not clear). We are also a super special class registered contractors with the Ministry of Defense which gives an unlimited tendering capability of ours. We have a good reputation as far as quality of delivery and timely delivery and the sectors in which we work include ports, defense, railways, private sectors and big corporates, steel industry, SR, any number of such companies we are associated. We could achieve a good track record of cumulative annual growth rate for the last five years consistently except for the last year, the details of which will be explained by the CMD\n",

      "Text: Thank you Ms. Astha and Mr. Jayachandran. Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen. I am Radhakrishna CMD of RKEC Projects Limited. It is my pleasure to welcome you all to our investor‚Äôs conference to discuss the financial performance of RKEC Projects Limited for the financial year 20-21 and also share with you our way forward. RKEC Private Limited is one of the leading infra companies which has 35 years of experience in the business of marine work and bridges. Company has completed 95 projects so far worth over 1830 crores and currently working on 14 projects amounting to Rs. 600 crores. During the financial year 21 the company could complete four projects. The notable ones are electrification work of Purvanchal Vidyut Vitraan Nigam Limited and ports like JNPT. Let me come to the order book first before getting into the financials. The company carries an order value of 883 crores for execution as of 1/4/2021 and secured an order of Rs. 134 crores after the financial year brought in about Rs. 1017 crores of orders on hand considering an average turnover of Rs.300 crores for financial year 20-21, 22 and Rs. 400 crores for financial 20-22 and 23. The company is having a sufficient order book on hand. We have also submitted big (not clear) project (not clear) Rs.1000 crores approximately and is bidding for another Rs. 600 crores by 31/12/2021. Considering a minimum surface of one third, we are expected to have a very comfortable RO position, of three years‚Äô turnover being available at any point of time. When I look at the turnover, it is seen that the turnover of the company has suffered a drop of Rs. 95 crores that is 33% as compared to the turnover of the previous year. Drop in turnover was due to multiple challenges faced by the company. The first one was due to the outbreak of the pandemic right from March 2020 and impacted throughout the financial year. The major projects which have suffered set backs are port, JNPT, Adani project, Haldia Project and sea project of the Indian Navy Visakhapatnam. The second challenge was on account of the slowdown in the construction activities in the Farakka Project. The slowdown of Farakka project was mainly due to an unfortunate accident on 16/2/2020 and the subsequent investigation studies and review of the design and ranks by multiple agencies. We are happy to inform you that our clients are being approved after the completion of all studies. The project will be back on track in another three months time after the monsoon, 2021. The third reason was that the company was suffering from the working capital constraint for the last two years on account of the receivable of Rs.65 crores from SSPUVDNL. I am happy to share with you that the contract has been revalidated, work has been completed and a debt of Rs.52 crores against Rs. 80 crores have already been collected which has provided a slight relief to the working capital position of the company. We are expecting the balance payment of Rs. 28 crores during the second quarter of the financial year 2021. We are probably one of the few contractors in India to have recovered money without penalty which shows the strength of the company and its integrity level. I congratulate all my staff who have struggled to receive this and also shareholders for having confidence and stood by us for over two years. While we could mitigate the three challenges, we are still left with one challenge on the working capital credit limits from Bank of Baroda. The sanction of credit limit of Bank of Baroda has also been received during June 2021. Sanction by the Bank is not very comfortable for the company to receive the increase in turnover. Infact the major set and are confident of mitigating it in the next two months‚Äô time. We bring to your kind notice that we have not removed any of our staff during the pandemic and full salaries were paid and the directors have sacrificed their salaries to pay them as they are the pillars and strength of the company. The profitability of the company reflected EBITDA of Rs. 82.94 crores during the financial year 2021 as against the previous years‚Äô performance of Rs. 69.61 crores. Similarly, the profit after tax for the year 2021 is Rs.12.76 crores as against Rs. 27.86 crores of 19-20. I would like to state that the drop in profit is directly the result of the drop in turnover as expenditure level remained almost the same. The company has adopted IND AS requirement as NSE main board listed companies thereby improving the standard. We have appointed a new CFO Mr. Jayachandran who is highly qualified and experienced. He is a qualified finance professional who has got 35 years of industry exposure. He possesses multi various and functional experience in various industries such as engineering, infrastructure, manufacturing etc. He has been (not sure) CFO for the last 25 years into the organization. His services are expected to benefit the company substantially. Mr. Satyanarayana has opted to retire as he has attained the age of 65 years. We are confident of the way forward by regaining the growth in turnover to Rs. 300 crores during the financial year 21-22; by adding on jobs of oil & gas, specialized billing with due diligence and thereby to add value to the investors in the coming years. Our strategy and philosophy of work can be considered to optimized operational (not clear) by enhancing the project execution capability and efficient project management to capture the industry growth potential, to retain and attract talent, to go for (not sure) billing by striking a balance between the risk profile of owning versus hiring. Our resources and capabilities do consists of our track record of completion of projects, long experience as a promoter in the construction sector, dedicated, robust and successful team, own fleet of construction equipment, long-term relationship with client, high quality, cost-effective project delivery capability, timely completion of projects, reasonable asset base for the size of the company. Coming to the short-term (not clear) I should say that despite the pandemic, stringent credit sanctioning norms insisted in banks and increase in price of steel are the major ones. We are confident of mitigating all the above during the financial year 21-22. The floor is now open for questions and answer session. You may now ask questions one by one. Kindly tell us your name and the organization you represent. Question and Answer Session\n",

Totally it is around 1000 crores of work order on hand. The major projects are Farakka project where unexecuted order value is around 288 crores, the second one is a project of jetty construction for Indian Navy in Visakhapatnam which is approximately 140 crores. The third one is‚Ä¶there are two projects in Calcutta Fortress that is Haldia Dock Complex. Together it is around 200 crores. The next one is the order which we recently got that is a construction of a fisheries harbor in Kakinada in a place called Uppada. The project is funded by NABARD and we have a back to back contract for the marine portion which is 134 crores. We do have few other projects already ongoing, many of them are in advanced stages of completion. One another project is in the west coast of India in Karnataka; that is Honnavar where we have got an unexecuted order value of about 75 crores. So this constitutes almost 1000 crores of the order book. Almost all the projects are already mobilized and work is up and running.\n",

In another month or one and a half month‚Äôs time we will be getting all the drawings approved. With revised drawings are primarily providing some more add ons and a few measures as added precaution and nothing else.

      "Text: Okay. Sir my next question is regarding our finances. You mentioned that there was some stress on the working capital. So what is our current bank (not clear) in terms of fund base and non-fund base. We already have pretty much a 1000-crore order. So how much more order we can bid? How much more bank guarantees we have? a cash credit limit of 37.5 crores. We are working on‚Ä¶.as far as the non-fund base limit is concerned, we are very much comfortable. As you may be knowing that after the outbreak of the pandemic, the government has given some relaxations as far as bank guarantees are concerned. Performance bank guarantees and retention bank guarantees have been relaxed to some 10% to 3%; so we are very much comfortable as far as the non-fund basis limit is concerned. However, due to the delay or due to the slowdown in the last year, we may need to pump in a bit more money as far as the working capital is concerned. Presently we have only 37.5. Ideally we should have around 60, 65 crores of working capital‚Ä¶.65 to 70 crores we may be requiring and we are sourcing it. We are working on various fronts only and we will be able to do it. This is required because we are planning to bring the turnover back to 300 plus in the current year.\n",

      "Text: As far as today we have about 14 projects up and running of which in the current financial year we will be completing and getting out around 8 to 9 projects because almost all of them are in advanced stages of completion; almost completed or substantial completion. By the year end if there is no further orders coming to us, we will be left with only five orders. So essentially we have the resources where we can definitely open up three to four major projects in the size of 200 crores; we can at least open three to four projects and we have also bid for two projects and we are confident of at least getting one out of it. So one or two projects more we will be able to get in the current financial year. Our strategy is that to always keep the order book on hand almost free of turnover. The reason is that the average delivery time is also 2-1/2 to 3 years‚Äô time. So we should be in a position to get once the‚Ä¶after finishing 1000 crores, third is what is going to be completed during the current financial year may be about 400, 500 600 crores may go out of the books, so additional 400, 500, or 600 crores will come in. So definitely we can accommodate another 600 to 700 crores of order even with the existing scale of things.\n",

To substantiate my statement I should say that we had renewed all the sundry debtors on 31st of March, all the receivables and we have found that two of the receivables which are almost 5, 6 years old, we in fact have written off these two debts. One from a company called SEW which has already gone to NCLT and the second one is also gone to NCLT called IVCRL. About 3.4 crores of debts which we ourselves assessed that yes there could be a stress and there is a doubtfulness on the case which we have analyzed and we have written off.

We will be completing some of the projects; whatever is there as explained by him about 8 to 9 projects we will be completing and in addition we can definitely take up around 600 to 1000 crores in this financial year, additional works of around 600 to 1000 crores in this financial year provided we enhance our credit limit to another s30 crores which we are doing and probably within another two months we should be able to do that. And the question asked, achieving the PBT and all that we are in a very positive mode to move to that extent but being in the pandemic situation and all we may not be able to commit to that level what would be the exact figures and all but we must be earning definitely better than the present year position sir.\n",

We have been saying that at the time when we go to the public our turnover was around 100 to 150 crores and I said we will go up to 300 to 400, stabilize this for about three years and then move on for further. The main‚Ä¶.basic reason why we want to go like that is, I want to develop my own strength of staff with me rather than scaling up so much projects higher, getting people from outside, we do not understand what is on their mind; by the time we understand their mind, the project is over and we may be either this side or that side. So I want to have a very stable and strong foundation by making (not sure) at the range of 300 to 400 crores, stabilize for three years, develop the fresh talent from the people we have taken up and then give them more projects in the future coming over here. So maybe around 300 to 500 we will stabilize in the three years and then afterwards we will scale upto 1000 crores. This is our plan actually.\n",

So probably I think once you compare 28 should be as a (not sure) when we compare one to one even though it is a bit abnormal.

If I look at the annual report of four years back around 2017, at that time‚Ä¶.and throughout 2016-17. In 2016 the revenue of the company was 113 crores and the receivables was around 20 crores. If I look at it from 2017, the revenue was around 200 crores and the receivable was around 40 crores. Again this year the revenue turnover is around 200 crores but you are talking about receivables which are 160 crores. So it is concerning as an investor to see that the receivables are increasing so sharply and also as the dividend is not being paid out in the last couple of years may be because the cash conversion is low. So it is sort of concerning us whether the company is actually able to get the receivables on time and convert it into cash so that three, four years trend is not showing in a good light for the company.\n",

So the figure is fading down to -80 crores so round about 88 crores is today‚Äôs position. The major recovery which we could asset is basically Purvanchal Vidyut Vitraan Nigam Limited and other customers. About 52 crores is from Purvanchal Vidyut Vitraan Nigam Limited. Further as earlier clarified by CMD, 28 crores is further receivable from one of the clients Purvanchal Vidyut Vitraan Nigam Limited which will also be collected in the current quarter, maybe in a month or two‚Äôs time. This month itself we will get around 12 and the balance we are expected to get before September. So I think the concern is real concern of the high receivables as compared to the turnover, but I am sure that may be the half year figures will definitely out do this.\n",

As such the debt equity ratio more or less remain the same I should say. Not much of a change. Rather the debts which we have taken is coming down. Of course it is a game of debt and equity. Equity remaining the same and debt not being increased, the position is that but one more point which we will have to manufacturing of many of the equipments of our own with materials and expertise (not clear) items.

This is mainly because of one project where around Rs. 45 crores is actually due from the work specified that is on rural electrification work of PurvanchalVidyut Nigam Limited. The work certified for payment, the total work value of the contract is around Rs. 120 crores and work certified for payment is Rs. 84 crores and actual payment received is Rs. 45 crores. So this is basically a back ended pricing formula which they are following for the release of payments. And practically the work for Rs. 106 to Rs. 110 crores have already been completed. So we expect the position should improve in current year once the work is completed. Because the end of work we should get higher payment.\n",

So these are all in the design stage so we will not be able to give you the exact figure.

      "Text: That is the reason why we are not entering into the road sector, though we have got lot of opportunities. Whenever we take up the work, the package is around 60 to 80 kilometers. Managing one kilometer is far easier than a road package of 60to 80 Kilometers. We have very good control in bridges due to the located projects and we have control over this but when you go in 60 kilometers controlling will be difficult. That is the reason we get a PAT value on the road sector a little bit less and on the bridges if you organize well you get a higher margins because the number of components in a big project is only around 6 to 7 like concrete, reinforcement, bearings, tiling etcetera but whereas when you go into the roads, you have got so many items. There is also a lot of problem with land acquisition, and theft also is another issue. So whereas in bridges, we concentrate at one location security and all will be easier. That is the reason we are trying to concentrate only on major bridges. And River Ganga bridge what we are doing is one of the prestigious projects of Prime Minister of India. He has chosen around 13 bridges on River Ganga, and out of which five bridges have been completed, three bridges are on tendering stage and another five bridges they are going to ask for bids. So this is one of the prestigious projects and we will not have any tax flow issues or anything on this project.\n",

So the department is in a fix whether they want to get the work executed through us or call for a separate tender. In my last two three visits, finally I think they are going for a separate tender and unless they execute that work, we will not be able to execute our job that is the reason there is a delay of about six months.
