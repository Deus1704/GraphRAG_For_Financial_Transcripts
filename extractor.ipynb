      "Moderator : Thank you very much. We will now begin the question and answer session. The f irst question \n",
      "comes from Prateek Kumar from Jefferies . Please go ahead.  \n",
      "Prateek Kumar:  My first question is on your capex number. First half capex  has been like Rs. 15,000 crore  based \n",
      "on your balance sheet data. How are we looking at capex now for full year because earlier we \n",
      "were anticipating a much larger capex for the full year. How are we looking at capex for the full \n",
      "year and segmental capex also, if you can provide there ? \n",
      "Robbie Singh:  For full year capex , I will go through various segments. So in New Industries, we expect the full \n",
      "year capex to be around Rs. 28,000  crore . On the Airport s side, the number including the Navi \n",
      "Mumbai A irport is around Rs. 16,000  crore . And we expect the road s to complete its projects on \n",
      "schedule with capex of roughly around Rs. 12,000  crore . Small capex would be there , but not a \n",
      "material number , in relation to water projects. In Data Center s, we expect to complete  roughly  Adani Enterprises Limited  \n",
      "October 29 , 202 4 \n",
      " \n",
      " Page 4 of 11 \n",
      "about Rs. 5,000 crore . And then in the remainder of the businesses, we expect to  complete the \n",
      "capex of further about Rs. 5,000  crore. Now the reason why this particular quarter and this half \n",
      "of the year is slightly slower than the remainder is because , as you know, in capex heavy \n",
      "business es, there's a natural cyclicality in India due to monsoons. So during the monsoon period, \n",
      "the capex slows down and it will start ramping up now and reaches its peak in Dec-Jan-Feb-Mar. \n",
      "And that peak then continues till May. And then the summer season starts and it starts winding \n",
      "down through to the monsoon. And this year the monsoon was about 6 to 7 weeks longer than \n",
      "traditional , so we might be plus or minus 6 weeks in terms of the schedule. But if you see our \n",
      "sort of operational update of June 2025, you will see that broadly capex numbers will be in line.  \n",
      "Prateek Kumar:  So broadly, still we are looking at Rs. 70,000 crore capex for this year from the numbers ? \n",
      "Robbie Singh:  I would say closer to roughly 67.  \n",
      "Prateek Kumar:  And sir , regarding the ANIL segment  (the new energy segment ), can you also lay out the timeline \n",
      "of projects like backward integration, module capacity expansion, where we are and when do \n",
      "we look at pilot projects for green energy and electrolyzers?  \n",
      "Robbie Singh:  Yeah, like I said, what we can highlight overall  is that manufacturing,  with the exception of \n",
      "foundry, is now practically up and running. So from ingot -wafer onwards  plus the ancillary \n",
      "industries are now fully i ntegrated, which is glass, back sheet, EVA, aluminum frames. So that \n",
      "aspect for the solar model is complete. Wind turbine is also from blade,  nacelle, assembly, or \n",
      "that work is already complete. For electrolyzer s, we have started the work and we expect to give \n",
      "you an update as to how that work is proceeding in terms of construction and development of \n",
      "the electrolyzer facility by March next year. So we are pretty much progressing on the site  \n",
      "development work , site civil planning work  for where the generation capacity of solar and wind \n",
      "will go has also commenced and we'll have a more detailed update towards the middle of the \n",
      "next year. For the downstream product work development, probably we will be able to give an \n",
      "update in the next 24 months, but we will have a much more detailed update in relation to the \n",
      "first two phases of manufacturing and the green power generation for green hydrogen in th e \n",
      "middle of the next year.  \n",
      "Prateek Kumar:  Okay, so the capital employed for the ANIL segment currently appears very less , probably at \n",
      "around Rs. 3 ,000–Rs. 4 ,000 crore  and we are looking to do Rs. 28,000 crores capex in this year . \n",
      "So this is going t owards expansion to capacity towards number that is what I was asking in terms \n",
      "of milestones , in terms of capacity targets . \n",
      "Robbie Singh:  No, what you are referring to is the manufacturing capex only. Under Adani green hydrogen \n",
      "business, we have 4 types of capex . The manufacturing ecosystem capex , which you are referring \n",
      "to; then the green hydrogen development capex ; then the electrolyzer capex , which is the \n",
      "electrolyzer on site, that's not the manufacturing ; and then the downstream capex of the \n",
      "downstream plants. So there is a full -fledged  plan as to how we see that develop ing over a period \n",
      "of time. What you are noticing now is the civil development. So the capex  numbers will start \n",
      "ramping up, as I said, over the next year, as we go through this development phase. So currently ,  Adani Enterprises Limited  \n",
      "October 29 , 202 4 \n",
      " \n",
      " Page 5 of 11 \n",
      "the focus has been to integrate the manufacturing ecosystem that is required to start the green \n",
      "electron production for the green molecule production.  \n",
      "Prateek Kumar:  Okay, sure. And can we also talk about like the airport segment? Because now the Navi Mumbai \n",
      "Airport is nearing completion, how are we looking at airlines addition or the start of flights from \n",
      "that airport by March 25 and the City Side Development projects which we are looking to \n",
      "develop at the airports to start with?  \n",
      "Robbie Singh:  So the first phase of the City Side D evelopment at Ahmedabad is underway. We have one more \n",
      "airport to start. Navi Mumbai Airport should click in, like you rightly pointed out , in the second \n",
      "calendar quarter of next year. The airline addition planning continue s. This time also , we \n",
      "reported that this quarter  we also brought 6 new airlines. Various airports are starting  that will \n",
      "continue to develop.  We expect the first phase of our pure City Side Development to come on line \n",
      "by 2026. The intermodal development at Ahmedabad is already up and running, wherein \n",
      "intermodal mean s where passengers and non -passengers can mix. And similarly, in Navi \n",
      "Mumbai , it will also be ready, the intermodal development  will be ready as soon as the terminal \n",
      "is ready. The City Side D evelopment there also will be a little bit longer. But overall, we expect \n",
      "to have the City Side D evelopment in sufficiently large numbers that shows up in our EBITDA \n",
      "by end of 2026. The other aspect of airports is the development  of its JV businesses which are \n",
      "ancillary business es in airport that is also going forward as planned.  \n",
      "Moderator:  Thank you.  The next question comes from Brett Knoblauch from Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go \n",
      "ahead.  \n",
      "Brett Knoblauch:  Let me just talk a minute about your data center business and what you guys are seeing there in \n",
      "terms of pipeline and demand. I know obviously a big trend around the world is AI and new high \n",
      "performance compute data centers. Do you guys have any plans to b uild data centers to support  \n",
      "higher shifts  that are coming to market,  and have you had any kind of talks surrounding that?  \n",
      "Robbie Singh:  Yes, we are geared up, Brett, for our data center business in the ultra-hyperscale  data centers in \n",
      "the AI space and also in the GPU space. We will actually make comprehensive data center as a \n",
      "showcase presentation as part of our annua l result in May next year. It would be much more \n",
      "appropriate to go through at that time. But suffice to say we are fully geared up for that, both \n",
      "from energy supply point of view, from land, from other connectivities and civil infrastructure \n",
      "point of view for the AI data center.  \n",
      "Brett Knoblauch:  Perfect. Thank you, that's helpful. And as you're thinking about the incubating businesses and \n",
      "maybe new businesses to come, would getting into anywhere on the AI supply chain or that \n",
      "market be interesting to you guys?  \n",
      "Robbie Singh:  Not the AI supply chain, but we have two large service businesses within AEL, which is our \n",
      "Adani Digital Labs and our Global Capability Center. The digital infrastructure rollout and \n",
      "consequent  development of smart systems  across those two businesses is a big drive internally \n",
      "for us . We don't report them separately at the moment because they are emerging businesses.  Adani Enterprises Limited  \n",

      " Page 6 of 11 \n",
      "Our focus in the first phase over the next five years is to focus on the incubation of airports, \n",
      "green hydrogen and the roads business plus data center. As we go through this development \n",
      "phase of our services  i.e. digital infrastructure services businesses, we will be outlining them in \n",
      "more detail. But I expect that currently it's more of R&D type of expenditure investment. We \n",
      "expect to provide full  briefings on the development of services business es in a meaningful way \n",
      "probably towards the end of this decade when they reach certain scale.  \n",
      "Moderator:  Thank you. The next question comes from Gaurav Birmiwal from Axis Mutual Fund . Please go \n",
      "ahead.  \n",
      "Gaurav Birmiwal:  I just wanted your thoughts on the external market outlook for the sales of our solar panels as \n",
      "well as the turbines that we are manufacturing ? \n",
      "Robbie Singh:  That demand remains relatively stable. I think over a period of time, we expect our installed \n",
      "capacity itself to double , but that would mean our own inhouse ecosystem demand will also \n",
      "ramp up. There's no  specific market shift that we can see in the short term, but over the medium \n",
      "term, in manufacturing and in export industries, you can have market shifts. But as we mature  \n",
      "in this segment in relation to the scale at which Adani Green is operating and the scale at which \n",
      "Adani N ew Industr ies will operate , I think that as manufacturing ecosystem itself will remain \n",
      "immune to outside market risks in the medium term, given how it is situated and given the scale \n",
      "at which the various sister firms of the group in this area are developing.  \n",
      "Moderator:  Thank you. The next question comes from  Gopal N from SBI Life Insurance . Please go ahead.  \n",
      "Gopal N:  My question was on, there is sequential moderation on the segment -wise EBITDA on ANIL. So \n",
      "can you just give some update on that why it is so?  \n",
      "Robbie Singh:  I think as I mentioned, if you recall, I don't know whether you were  on th at call or not in March  \n",
      "that sometimes you have order spillovers which come after the balance date, which was in the \n",
      "first quarter. So , the order book is no w tracking at about 1 gigawatt, just over 1.1 gigawatt and \n",
      "capacity is 4.5  gigawatt . So we are pretty much running at capacity for the quarter.  Last quarter, \n",
      "the 1.3 gigawatt  that was largely driven by sales recorded in that first quarter , which were \n",
      "produced during previous quarter.  \n",
      "Gopal N:  And this should be the run rate for the remaining part of the year?  \n",
      "Robbie Singh:  Yeah, we have about 4.5 gigawatt capacity, so we'll run at close to 1.1 -1.2 gigawatt . \n",
      "Gopal N:  And there is no change in the export market in terms of demand ? \n",
      "Robbie Singh:  No, it's pretty steady.  \n",
      "Gopal N:  And sir, on this road assets  EBITDA , there is an improvement in the quarter -on-quarter and year -\n",
      "on-year.  In terms of revenue sequentially there is no change. So wh at is driving this change, sir?   Adani Enterprises Limited  \n",
      "October 29 , 202 4 \n",
      " \n",
      " Page 7 of 11 \n",
      "Robbie Singh:  That's largely because of achieving the commercial operations on the two road projects.  \n",
      "Gopal N:  But there is no chang e in the revenues sequentially.  \n",
      "Robbie Singh:  That is just an accounting artifact , where the EBITDA numbers are now recorded because COD \n",
      "date has been achieved. So the revenue number was recorded , but because of the COD \n",
      "achievement we recorded the EBITDA into accounting  now.  \n",
      "Gopal N:  And th e last bit was on interest on P& L. There is a drop sequentially and year -on-year also, \n",
      "whereas we have seen net debt going up . So how should we see it, sir?  \n",
      "Robbie Singh:  I think from a practical aspect, you should assume that interest will remain steady  and slightly \n",
      "rise as our constituent businesses are  growing . This particular time, what has happen ed is that \n",
      "we do have some FX-based borrowing , so there was some FX gain that is reflected in the rates.  \n",
      "Gopal N:  Can you quantify that amount?  \n",
      "Robbie Singh:  Approximately Rs. 200 crore.  \n",
      "Gopal N:  So that Rs. 1 ,100-Rs. 1,150 crore run rate should be ther e? \n",
      "Robbie Singh:  Yes. \n",
      "Moderator:  Thank you. The next questi on comes from Mr. Aditya Bharti a. Please go ahead, sir.  \n",
      "Aditya Bhartia:  Sir, my first question is on capex on ANIL . How much capex are we envisaging for the next 3 \n",
      "years? And how would you broadly split this capex into the four categories that you mentioned ; \n",
      "manufacturing, green hydrogen development , onsite el ectrolyz er and downstream capex ? \n",
      "Robbie Singh:  Broadly, we have a tighter range on the say for the next two years, so I don't want to give a  \n",
      "number that could be out  materially in terms of focus . We expect that  we would have a  capex  \n",
      "this year included plus the next year, roughly  around the Rs. 56,000 crore mark.  Of this , majority \n",
      "you can assume that about 60% of this or maybe slightly higher than 60% of this will be in the \n",
      "generation of the green electron. And downstream initially will be less but could be closer to \n",
      "about say  Rs. 4,000 crore. But that can shift  to a year later depending on how the schedule is \n",
      "going.  \n",
      "Aditya Bhartia:  Understood. And sir my second question is, some media articles that have been there about \n",
      "Adani E nterprises looking to acquire ITD Cementation, just wanted to understand what's the \n",
      "rationale of exploring  buying a construction company?  \n",
      "Robbie Singh:  AEL is not doing that at all. It's a wrong media article . As you see  roughly, I think it's on the \n",
      "third page of our presentation  and every presentation we have , there is a company called Adani \n",

      "Moderator:  Thank you. The next question comes from Vineet Prasad from Investec. Please go ahead.  \n",
      "Vineet Prasad:  Just a couple of questions. Firstly, we were ramping up on the wafer capacity until last quarter. \n",
      "So how is that shaped up? Have the manufacturing stabilized out there?  \n",
      "Robbie Singh:  So the wafer plant is basically at a point where we started the first wafer production . We expect \n",
      "it to complete its stabilization phase over the next 3 months and then it will start ramping up to \n",
      "its capacity over the next 12 months after that from January onwards.  \n",
      "Vineet Prasad:  Understood. And on the IRM and the mining side of things, how do you expect volume trends \n",
      "there for the remainder of the year ? \n",
      "Robbie Singh:  Flat to maybe slightly increasing.  \n",
      "Moderator:  Thank you. The next question comes from Nirav Shah from GeeCee Holdings. Please go ahead.  \n",
      "Nirav Shah:  So a few questions. First is on the airport side, I mean for our 6 PPP airports. So can you just \n",
      "elaborate on the timelines for the tariff increase because that has been approved but it has not \n",
      "been effective. So will we see all the tariff increases in pla ce by end of the  year or I mean if you \n",
      "just can give the timelines please , that would be helpful ? \n",
      "Robbie Singh:  The order was received last quarter, and it will start showing up in the numbers from the last \n",
      "quarter of this financial year and first calendar quarter next year.  \n",
      "Nirav Shah:  So all six airports, tariff entries w ill be between January to June.  \n",
      "Robbie Singh:  Three airports in the first, and then three will sta rt from about middle next year.  \n",

      "concessions or for duty -free or other businesses. So can you just explain how are we looking at \n",

      "segment?  \n",
      "Robbie Singh:  International airports will not be a material part of anything that we do in the medium term. The \n",
      "main focus remains on India. And so it's not a material number. The subsidiary formation relates \n",
      "to the fact that within Adani A irports, we have very large emerging business in relation to duty -\n",
      "free. So that's more consolidating the purchasing entity in one location  so that we can streamline \n",
      "the duty -free business. And duty -free business itself also operates duty -free stores outside of our \n",
      "airport s as well. So it has its own business plan. If there's anything specific on that, it's not a \n",
      "major capex business, and is more of a concession business. So there's no capex impact of this, \n",
      "but there's a business of duty -free which will develop outside of India as well.  \n",

      "the overall 10 gigawatt capacity will be done in synchronization , in fact, for glass, back sheet , \n",
